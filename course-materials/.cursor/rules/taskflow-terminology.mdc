# TaskFlow Terminology & Style Guide

## Product Terminology

**Always use these terms consistently:**

- **Workspace** - The top-level container (NOT "Project" at the top level)
- **Project** - Collections of related tasks within a Workspace
- **Task** - Individual work items (NOT "To-do" or "Item")
- **Epic** - Large features spanning multiple tasks
- **Cycle** - Our 2-week iteration period (NOT "Sprint")
- **Activation** - When a user completes key setup steps (NOT "Onboarding completion")
- **Member** - Individual user in a Workspace (NOT "User" in product copy)

## User Personas

**Reference these personas in examples and documentation:**

### Sarah - Enterprise Admin
- 38, VP of IT Operations
- Manages 800 employees at Series C company
- Needs: SSO, audit logs, advanced permissions, security controls
- Pain points: Tool sprawl, security visibility, onboarding/offboarding complexity

### Mike - IC Engineer  
- 29, Senior Software Engineer
- Works at 150-person Series B company
- Needs: Keyboard shortcuts, fast performance, GitHub integration, clear priorities
- Pain points: Priority confusion, context switching, too many meetings

### Alex - Team Lead
- 35, Engineering Manager
- Manages team of 8 engineers at 200-person company
- Needs: Team dashboard, workload visibility, sprint reports
- Pain points: No team visibility, constant interruptions, manual reporting

## Writing Style

**Voice & Tone:**
- Active voice preferred (e.g., "Create a task" not "A task can be created")
- Conversational but professional (approachable, not overly casual)
- No emojis in product documentation or announcements
- Use Oxford commas in all lists
- Second person ("you") for user-facing content

**Example Quality:**
- Use real persona names (Sarah, Mike, Alex) in examples
- Include specific, realistic use cases
- Avoid generic "User A" or "Team 1" style examples
- Ground examples in actual workflows

**Documentation Standards:**
- Start with "why" before "how"
- Include real-world context for features
- Use concrete examples over abstract descriptions
- Keep sentences concise (aim for 15-20 words)

## Feature Communication

**When announcing features:**
- Lead with the user benefit, not the feature name
- Reference specific persona pain points the feature solves
- Include realistic usage examples with our personas
- Use "Workspace" and other terminology consistently
- Avoid technical jargon unless absolutely necessary

**Example Structure:**
1. What's new (the benefit)
2. Why it matters (the problem it solves)
3. How it works (specific, persona-based examples)
4. How to get started (clear next steps)
