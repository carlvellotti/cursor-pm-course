**Subject:** Onboarding Research - Critical Churn Pattern Identified

We completed onboarding user research (12 interviews, 200+ survey responses) and identified a critical churn pattern affecting our bottom line. 40% of new users create solo workspaces and never invite team members, and these solo users churn at 68% versus 22% for collaborative teams - costing us approximately $4,080 in MRR monthly.

The research reveals three interconnected issues: users don't understand that TaskFlow's core value is team collaboration (only 38% correctly identified this), the team invite step is buried on the second onboarding screen with 73% skipping it, and there's no follow-up mechanism to recover these users. The business impact is clear - if we reduce solo workspace creation from 40% to 20%, we could save $2,040 MRR monthly, or roughly $24,000 annually.

I recommend a two-part fix: redesign the invite step to emphasize collaborative value and make skipping less prominent (target: reduce skip rate from 73% to 50%), plus implement a 24-hour follow-up email for users who skip (expected to recover 20% of solo users). Design work starts May 18, email implementation by May 20. I need your approval to prioritize these changes and confirm we're aligned on the 60-day goal of reducing solo workspace rate to 25%.
