Quick onboarding research update 📊

Found a critical churn pattern: 40% of users create solo workspaces and never invite teams. These solo users churn at 68% vs 22% for teams - that's ~$4K MRR lost monthly. Root cause: invite step is buried and value prop isn't clear.

Next: @jamie redesigning invite flow (target May 18), @alex building 24hr reminder email (target May 20). Goal: reduce solo workspace rate from 40% to 25% in 60 days.
