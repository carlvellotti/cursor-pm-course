# Module 0.3: Opening the Course Folder
## Reference Guide

**Last Updated:** November 9, 2024
**Time to Complete:** 5 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Cursor installed (Module 0.2)

---

## 📖 Overview

Download the course files and open them in Cursor to unlock interactive lessons with slash commands.

**Key takeaway:** Download ZIP from website, unzip to Documents, open folder in Cursor, verify file structure.

---

## Download Course Files

**[📥 Download Course Files (Latest Release)](https://github.com/REPO-URL/releases/latest)**

The ZIP file (`cursor-for-pms-main.zip`) downloads automatically to your Downloads folder.

## Unzip Course Files

**Mac:**
1. Open Downloads folder
2. Double-click the ZIP file
3. A new folder appears: `cursor-for-pms-main`
4. Drag this folder to your Documents folder (or preferred location)

**Windows:**
1. Open Downloads folder
2. Right-click the ZIP file
3. Select **Extract All**
4. Choose destination (Documents folder recommended)
5. Click **Extract**

> ⚠️ **Important:** Remember where you put this folder. You'll open it in Cursor next.

## Open Folder in Cursor

You have three ways to open the course folder in Cursor:

### Method 1: File Menu

1. Launch Cursor
2. Click **File → Open Folder** (Mac) or **File → Open Folder** (Windows)
3. Navigate to where you unzipped the files (e.g., Documents)
4. Select the `cursor-for-pms-main` folder
5. Click **Open**

### Method 2: Drag and Drop

1. Launch Cursor
2. Open Finder (Mac) or File Explorer (Windows)
3. Navigate to the `cursor-for-pms-main` folder
4. Drag the entire folder onto Cursor's window
5. Cursor opens the folder as a project

### Method 3: Welcome Screen

1. Launch Cursor
2. On the welcome screen, click **Open Folder**
3. Navigate to `cursor-for-pms-main`
4. Click **Open**

---

## Trust the Folder

When you open the folder, Cursor may ask:

> **"Do you trust the authors of files in this folder?"**

Click **Yes, I trust the authors**.

**Why this appears:** Cursor protects you from potentially malicious code. Since you downloaded these course files from the official website, they're safe to trust.

---

## Verify Setup

### Check File Explorer

After opening the folder, you should see a **File Explorer** on the left side showing:

```
cursor-for-pms-main/
├── .cursor/
│   ├── commands/
│   └── rules/
├── company-context/
├── lesson-modules/
└── README.md
```

**Don't see File Explorer?** Click **View → Sidebar** or press `Cmd+B` (Mac) / `Ctrl+B` (Windows).

### Test Slash Commands

1. Open **Composer** by pressing `Cmd+I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows)
2. Type `/` in the input box
3. You should see a dropdown with commands like `/start-1-1`, `/start-1-2`, etc.

**If you see the slash commands, you're ready!** These commands trigger the interactive lessons.

---

## Quick Navigation

Now that your folder is open, here's what you need to know:

**File Explorer (Left sidebar):**
- Browse all course files
- Click files to open them
- Expand/collapse folders with arrows

**Composer (Cmd+I or Ctrl+I):**
- Where you'll interact with Claude
- Type slash commands to start lessons
- Type questions or requests

**That's it for now.** Module 1.1 will walk you through everything in detail.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the File Explorer"
**Fix:** Press `Cmd+B` (Mac) or `Ctrl+B` (Windows) to toggle the sidebar. Or click View → Sidebar.

### "Slash commands don't appear when I type /"
**Fix:** Make sure you opened the folder (not individual files). Close Cursor, then use File → Open Folder and select the entire `cursor-for-pms-main` folder.

### "The folder structure looks different"
**Fix:** You may have opened a subfolder by mistake. Close Cursor and open the top-level folder (the one containing `.cursor`, `company-context`, and `lesson-modules`).

### "Cursor asks me to trust the folder every time"
**Fix:** Make sure you clicked "Yes, I trust the authors" and checked "Trust all files in parent folder" (if that option appears).
