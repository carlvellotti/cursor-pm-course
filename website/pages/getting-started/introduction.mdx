# Module 0.1: Introduction to Cursor for PMs
## Reference Guide

**Last Updated:** November 9, 2024
**Time to Complete:** 10 minutes
**Prerequisites:** None

---

## 📖 Overview

Cursor is an AI-powered IDE (text editor) that transforms how Product Managers work with documents, data, and text. Unlike traditional coding tools, Cursor lets PMs use AI to create, edit, and analyze files through natural conversation—no terminal commands required.

**This course is done entirely in Cursor.** You'll learn Cursor by using Cursor—the course materials open in the application, and Claude guides you through interactive lessons inside the editor.

**Key takeaway:** Cursor saves PMs 10-20 hours per week by automating document creation, research analysis, meeting note processing, and repetitive PM work.

## What Cursor Does for PMs

Cursor combines a familiar text editor interface (like VS Code) with powerful AI capabilities specifically useful for Product Management work.

**Core capabilities:**

| Feature | What PMs Use It For |
|---------|-------------------|
| **@ Mentions** | Reference files, folders, docs, or codebase in conversation |
| **Composer** | Multi-file editing and creation in a dedicated panel |
| **Chat** | Quick questions, analysis, and single-file tasks |
| **Cmd+K** | Inline editing directly in files |
| **Project Rules** | Set context and AI behavior for your projects |
| **Templates** | Reusable document structures |

**What makes it different:**
- **Visual interface** - See your files, folders, and changes (not just terminal text)
- **File system integration** - AI works directly with your actual files
- **Persistent context** - AI remembers your project setup via `.cursorrules` files
- **Beginner-friendly** - No coding or command-line experience needed

| PRD first draft | 4-6 hours | 1-2 hours | 3-4 hours |
| Meeting note processing | 2-3 hours | 30 min | 2 hours |
| Research synthesis | 4-5 hours | 1-2 hours | 3 hours |
| Documentation updates | 2-3 hours | 45 min | 2 hours |
| Ticket creation | 3-4 hours | 1 hour | 2-3 hours |
| **Total** | **15-21 hours** | **5-7 hours** | **12-15 hours** |

## Course Time Investment

**Foundation Level (Modules 0-1):**
- Setup and basics: 2-3 hours
- Returns: Immediate time savings on basic tasks

**Intermediate Level (Module 2):**
- Real PM workflows: 3-4 hours
- Returns: Handle complex multi-file work

**Advanced Level (Module 3):**
- Advanced techniques: 2-3 hours
- Returns: Orchestrate complex projects

**Total: 7-10 hours for full mastery**

**ROI:** After one week, you'll have saved more time than you invested.

## The Mindset Shift

### From Manual Executor to Orchestrator

**Before Cursor:**
1. Open file
2. Copy content
3. Paste into ChatGPT
4. Copy response back
5. Manual formatting
6. Repeat for each file

**With Cursor:**
1. Ask AI to work with your files
2. AI handles everything
3. Review and refine

**Example:**
- **Old way:** Spend 3 hours manually creating 20 user story tickets from a PRD
- **Cursor way:** "Create Jira stories from this PRD using our ticket template" (15 minutes)

### Conversation Over Commands

Cursor doesn't require learning terminal commands or coding syntax. You work with AI through natural conversation:

- ❌ Don't need: `grep -r "TODO" . | awk '{print $1}'`
- ✅ Just say: "Find all TODO items across these files"

### Persistent Context

Unlike web chatbots, Cursor remembers your project setup:

- **Project rules** define how AI should behave
- **File references** stay accessible without re-uploading
- **Templates** standardize outputs across your team
