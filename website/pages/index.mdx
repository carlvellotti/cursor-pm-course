# Cursor for Product Managers

![Cursor AI interface comparison showing the power of AI-assisted PM work](/images/cursorforpmsthumbnail.png)

## Learn Cursor IN Cursor!

This course is taught entirely inside Cursor itself 😈

- You'll install Cursor, download the course files, then type `/start-1-1` to begin
- The AI in Cursor guides you through each module interactively
- You learn by doing real PM work with real files in an AI-powered editor

## Who This Course Is For

**Product Managers** who want to learn the most powerful way to use LLMs for work.

Cursor isn't just a code editor. It's an AI-powered workspace that transforms how PMs work:
- Reads your user research, edits PRDs, analyzes data across multiple files
- Uses Chat, Composer, and Cmd+K to handle different types of tasks
- Remembers context about your product through project rules
- Analyzes screenshots and mockups you paste directly into chat
- Acts as custom AI reviewers (engineer, executive, UX) before you share work with your team

This is AI integrated into your actual workflow, not bolted on as a chat window.

**You don't need coding or terminal experience.** If you can describe what you want in plain English, you can use Cursor.

## What You'll Learn

**Core Cursor capabilities:**
- **Chat, Composer, and Cmd+K:** Master the three interaction modes for different PM tasks
- **File operations:** Read, write, and edit documents directly with AI assistance
- **Slash commands:** Create custom workflows that trigger specialized teaching scripts
- **Project rules:** Use `.cursorrules` to maintain persistent context about your product
- **@-mentions:** Reference files, folders, and docs to give the AI full context
- **Image analysis:** Paste screenshots and mockups for instant feedback

**Applied to real PM work:**
- Process meeting transcripts and extract action items
- Synthesize user research from multiple sources
- Write PRDs with multi-perspective feedback
- Analyze product data and run experiments
- Develop competitive strategy and create presentations
