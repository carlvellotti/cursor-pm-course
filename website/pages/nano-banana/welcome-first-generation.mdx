## 3.1.1: Welcome & First Generation

- **Time to Complete:** 10 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Nano Banana files downloaded (Module 3.0)

> **Start this module in Cursor:** Run `/start-3-1-1` to begin the interactive experience.

## Overview

Module 3.1.1 gets you from zero to your first AI-generated image. You'll set up your Gemini API key, configure billing, and watch as the AI transforms a reference photo into something magical.

**Key takeaway:** The setup is a one-time process. Once your API key is configured, you can generate images with simple natural language requests - The AI handles all the technical complexity.


## What is Gemini 3 Pro?

**Gemini 3 Pro** (codenamed "Nano Banana Pro") is Google's most advanced image generation model. It can:

- Generate photorealistic images from text descriptions
- Transform reference photos while preserving identity
- Add accurate text overlays to images
- Create consistent characters across multiple generations
- Understand and replicate complex visual styles

Unlike consumer apps, accessing the API directly gives you:
- **More permissive content policies** (e.g., real people as references)
- **Full parameter control** (aspect ratio, resolution, etc.)
- **Session-based iteration** (refine images step-by-step)
- **Lower cost** (~$0.10/image vs subscription apps)


## Setting Up Your API Key

### Step 1: Get Your Key from Google AI Studio

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Accept the Terms of Service (if first time)
4. Click **"Get API Key"** in the left sidebar
5. Click **"Create API key"** in the upper right to generate a new key
6. Name your key whatever you want and select "Default Gemini Project"
7. Click on the key in the dashbaord
8. Copy the key - it starts with `AIza...`

Keep this key safe. You'll paste it into your `.env` file in Step 3.

### Step 2: Set Up Billing

Gemini 3 Pro requires a billing account. Don't worry - it's pay-per-use and very affordable.

1. In Google AI Studio, go to **Get API key** (bottom of left sidebar)
2. Under the "Quota tier" column, click **Set up billing**
3. Follow the prompts to add a payment method

**Cost context:**
- ~$0.10 per image generation
- This entire course costs less than $5 total
- No monthly subscription - just pay for what you use
- This money goes to **Google**, not Carl (unfortunately)

### Step 3: Configure Your API Key

Just tell the AI your API key and it will set everything up:

> "My Gemini API key is AIzaYourKeyHere - please add it to my .env file"

The AI will create the `.env` file and store your key securely.

**Prefer to do it manually?** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your key: `GEMINI_API_KEY=YourKeyHere`


## Your First Generation

Once setup is complete, you're ready to generate. In the interactive module, The AI uses a reference photo to create a fun welcome image - demonstrating the model's ability to transform real photos.

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. You describe what you want
2. The AI calls the `generate()` function from `image_gen.py`
3. The function sends your request to Gemini's API
4. The generated image is saved to the `outputs/` folder
5. The AI tells you where to find it

**Generation time:** About 10-15 seconds per image.


## What the AI Handles for You

When you generate images through Cursor, you don't need to worry about:

| You handle | The AI handles |
|------------|----------------|
| Describing what you want | API calls and authentication |
| Choosing styles | Session management |
| Providing feedback | File saving and naming |
| Reviewing outputs | Parameter optimization |

This is the power of combining Gemini with Cursor. You focus on creative direction; The AI handles implementation.


## The `image_gen.py` Module

All image generation runs through a pre-built Python module called `image_gen.py`. You don't need to write any code - The AI uses it on your behalf.

**Key functions:**
- `generate()` - Create or refine an image
- `new_session()` - Start fresh (clear conversation history)
- `session_info()` - Check current session status

**You'll learn more about these in Module 3.1.2.**


## Output Structure

Generated images are saved to the `outputs/` folder in your nano-banana directory:

```
nano-banana/
├── outputs/
│   ├── image_001.png
│   ├── image_002.png
│   └── ...
├── image_gen.py
├── .env
└── ...
```

Images are numbered sequentially. The AI will tell you the exact path to each generated image so you can open it in Finder (Mac) or Explorer (Windows).


## Troubleshooting

### "API key not found" or authentication errors

- Verify your `.env` file exists (not `.env.example`)
- Check that the key is pasted correctly with no extra spaces
- Make sure the key starts with `AIza`

### "Billing not enabled" errors

- Return to Google AI Studio → Settings → Plan information
- Confirm billing is set up and a payment method is linked
- It may take a few minutes for billing to activate

### Generation fails or times out

- Check your internet connection
- Gemini may be experiencing high load - wait a minute and try again
- If errors persist, try starting a new session: tell the AI "Start a new session"

### Can't find generated images

- Images save to the `outputs/` folder
- The AI will provide the exact path after each generation
- Open Finder (Mac) or Explorer (Windows) and navigate to the folder


## Best Practices

**Keep your API key secure:**
- Never commit `.env` to git (it's in `.gitignore` by default)
- Don't share your API key publicly
- You can regenerate keys in Google AI Studio if compromised

**Check outputs in a proper viewer:**
- Terminal can't display images - always open the file
- Use Preview (Mac), Photos (Windows), or any image viewer
- For best experience, keep the `outputs/` folder open while working


## What You'll Learn Next

Module 3.1.1 gets you set up. The rest of Module 3.1 teaches you to use image generation effectively:

- **3.1.2: Understanding the Basics** - Parameters, aspect ratios, resolution, iteration
- **3.1.3: Consistency & Style** - Golden Rules of prompting, reference images, variants
- **3.1.4: Building Your Style Database** - Create a reusable library of styles

Then Module 3.2 applies these skills to real PM work: personas, diagrams, mockups, and marketing assets.


## What's Next?

You're set up and you've generated your first image. Now it's time to understand how the system works.

**Module 3.1.2** teaches you about the `generate()` function, available parameters, and how to iterate on your images.

Interactive track: Type `/start-3-1-2`
