## 3.2.1: Users & Product Visuals

- **Time to Complete:** 25 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Module 3.1 completed (style database built)

> **Start this module in Cursor:** Run `/start-3-2-1` to begin the interactive experience.

## Overview

Module 3.2.1 applies your image generation skills to real PM deliverables. You'll create the visual assets needed for product pitches: persona portraits, journey maps, wireframes, device mockups, and hero images.

**Key takeaway:** These techniques work for any pitch or presentation. Once you can generate these five asset types, you can visually communicate almost any product story.


## The Scenario

Throughout Module 3.2, you're a PM at TaskFlow (the course's fictional B2B SaaS company). You're pitching **TaskFlow Mobile** - a new mobile app for operations managers in manufacturing.

Your pitch deck needs:
1. **Persona portrait** - "Who are we building for?"
2. **Journey map** - "What problem are we solving?"
3. **Wireframe** - "What does the solution look like?"
4. **Device mockup** - "How does it feel in hand?"
5. **Hero image** - "What's the vision?"

Let's build each one.


## Persona Portraits

### What They Are

Persona portraits put a face to your target user. They make abstract user segments feel real and help stakeholders empathize with the people you're building for.

### When to Use

- Pitch deck "Who" slides
- User research presentations
- PRD persona sections
- Team alignment documents

### How to Generate

**Basic prompt:**
```
Create a persona portrait of [name], a [role] at [company type].
[Age range], [key characteristics]. Professional but approachable.
For a pitch deck.
```

**Example - Marcus Chen:**
```
Create a persona portrait of Marcus Chen, an operations manager
at a manufacturing plant. Mid-40s, practical, confident but
approachable expression. Wearing work-appropriate attire -
polo shirt, maybe a safety vest. Natural lighting.
For a pitch deck to leadership.
```

### Style Options

| Style | Best for | Example prompt addition |
|-------|----------|------------------------|
| **Photo-realistic** | Executive presentations | "Photorealistic, professional headshot quality" |
| **Illustrated** | Friendly/casual contexts | "Illustrated in a modern flat style" |
| **Stylized** | Brand-specific needs | Reference your style library |

### Pro Tips

- **Add context clues:** Include environment hints (factory floor, office, etc.)
- **Match the tone:** Executive pitch = more formal; team wiki = more casual
- **Be consistent:** If you have multiple personas, use the same style for all


## Journey Maps

![Journey map examples - minimalist and hand-drawn styles](/images/nano-banana/journey-map-minimalist.png)

### What They Are

Journey maps visualize a user's experience over time - the steps, touchpoints, pain points, and emotions throughout a process.

### When to Use

- Problem definition slides
- User research findings
- Solution framing
- Stakeholder alignment

### How to Generate

**Basic prompt:**
```
Create a journey map showing [user]'s [process/workflow].
Stages: [list stages]. Show pain points at each stage.
Clean, presentation-ready, 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

**Example - Marcus's morning:**
```
Create a journey map showing an operations manager's morning workflow.
Stages: Arrive (6am) → Review backlog → Morning standup → Floor walk → Handoff prep.
Show pain points: scattered information, manual tracking, delayed updates.
Clean visual style suitable for a pitch deck. 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

### Style Options

| Style | Best for |
|-------|----------|
| **Minimalist** | Executive presentations |
| **Hand-drawn** | Workshop/collaborative feel |
| **Infographic** | Marketing/external use |
| **Detailed** | Deep-dive presentations |

### Pro Tips

- **Include emotions:** Happy/frustrated faces at each stage add impact
- **Highlight pain points:** Red zones or icons draw attention to problems
- **Keep it scannable:** 5-7 stages max; detail goes in supporting docs


## Wireframe Transformation

![Wireframe examples - grayscale and hand-drawn sketch styles](/images/nano-banana/wireframe-grayscale.png)

### What It Is

Transform rough sketches into polished wireframes. This is perfect for taking meeting whiteboard sketches and making them presentation-ready.

### When to Use

- After brainstorming sessions
- Early-stage design reviews
- Quick concept validation
- When you don't have a designer available

### How to Generate

**Basic prompt:**
```
Transform this hand-drawn sketch into a clean, polished wireframe.
Keep the same layout and elements. Professional quality with
clean lines and consistent spacing.
```

Provide your rough sketch as a reference image.

**Example:**
```
Transform this hand-drawn wireframe into a polished mobile app wireframe.
Preserve the layout: header with greeting, task list, shift overview,
bottom navigation. Clean, professional, grayscale with good typography.
Mobile aspect ratio (9:16).
```

### What to Include in Sketches

Even rough sketches should show:
- Overall layout structure
- Key UI elements (headers, buttons, lists)
- Content hierarchy
- Navigation patterns

Gemini will clean up the visuals while preserving your layout decisions.

### Pro Tips

- **Keep sketches clear:** Gemini needs to understand your intent
- **Label elements:** Write text in your sketch so Gemini knows what goes where
- **Specify fidelity:** "Low-fi wireframe" vs "high-fidelity mockup"


## Device Mockups

![Device mockup examples - iPhone and MacBook frames](/images/nano-banana/device-iphone-light.png)

### What They Are

Device mockups place your wireframes or screenshots into phone/laptop frames. They make digital products feel tangible.

### When to Use

- App store preview images
- Pitch deck product slides
- Marketing materials
- Social media announcements

### How to Generate

**Basic prompt:**
```
Place this wireframe into a [device] mockup.
Clean background, slight shadow for depth.
Professional, presentation-ready.
```

Provide your wireframe as a reference image.

**Example:**
```
Put this mobile wireframe into an iPhone 15 Pro mockup.
Clean white background with subtle shadow.
Slight 3D angle to show depth. Professional quality.
```

### Device Options

| Device | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| **iPhone** | Mobile app pitches |
| **Android** | Cross-platform or Android-first |
| **MacBook** | Web apps, dashboards |
| **iPad** | Tablet experiences |
| **Multiple devices** | Responsive design showcases |

### Pro Tips

- **Match the context:** iPhone for consumer, MacBook for enterprise
- **Use current devices:** Latest models feel more premium
- **Consider angles:** Flat for clarity, angled for dynamism
- **Add context:** Hands holding the device adds authenticity


## Lifestyle Shots

![Lifestyle shot example - persona in office environment](/images/nano-banana/persona-scene-office-modern.png)

### What They Are

Lifestyle shots show your product in real-world use. They're the "hero images" that sell the vision - a person using your product in their natural environment.

### When to Use

- Pitch deck covers
- Landing pages
- Marketing hero images
- Social media announcements

### How to Generate

**Basic prompt:**
```
A [persona] using [product] in [environment].
[Specific details about context]. Natural lighting.
Composition suitable for [use case].
```

**Example:**
```
Marcus, an operations manager in his mid-40s, using TaskFlow Mobile
on the factory floor. He's holding his phone confidently, reviewing
task updates. Manufacturing environment in the background - equipment,
workers, industrial setting. Natural lighting from warehouse windows.
Composition works as a pitch deck hero image.
```

### Composition Tips

| Element | Guidance |
|---------|----------|
| **Subject placement** | Rule of thirds; leave space for text overlay if needed |
| **Background** | Relevant but not distracting; adds context |
| **Lighting** | Natural usually feels more authentic |
| **Expression** | Should match the story (confident, focused, satisfied) |

### Pro Tips

- **Use persona consistency:** Generate the same "Marcus" across all images
- **Match the environment:** Office for B2B SaaS, home for consumer apps
- **Leave text space:** If it's a hero image, leave room for headlines
- **Generate variants:** Try different compositions and pick the best


## Complete Pitch Deck Example

Here's how all five assets work together for the TaskFlow Mobile pitch:

### Slide 1: The Hero
**Asset:** Lifestyle shot of Marcus using TaskFlow Mobile on the factory floor
**Story:** "This is the future we're building"

### Slide 2: The User
**Asset:** Persona portrait of Marcus Chen
**Story:** "Meet Marcus - our target user"

### Slide 3: The Problem
**Asset:** Journey map of Marcus's chaotic morning
**Story:** "His current workflow is broken"

### Slide 4: The Solution
**Asset:** Polished wireframe of TaskFlow Mobile
**Story:** "Here's what we're building"

### Slide 5: The Vision
**Asset:** Device mockup (iPhone with wireframe)
**Story:** "Task management in your pocket"

**Total time:** 15-20 minutes for all five assets.


## Using Your Style Library

Remember the style library from Module 3.1.4? It shines here.

**For consistency:**
```
Generate Marcus persona portrait using style #12
Generate journey map using style #15
```

**For exploring options:**
```
Show me all persona styles in my library
Generate Marcus using style #12, #15, and #18 as variants
```

The more styles you build, the faster this becomes.


## Best Practices

### Do:
- **Match styles across a deck** - consistency looks professional
- **Use TaskFlow context** - or your real company context
- **Generate at 1K first** - iterate, then go to 2K for finals
- **Save good styles** - add them to your library
- **Generate variants** - especially for hero images

### Don't:
- **Don't mix wildly different styles** - it looks unprofessional
- **Don't skip iteration** - first drafts are rarely final
- **Don't over-detail wireframes** - they should feel like wireframes
- **Don't forget context** - tell the AI what it's for


## Troubleshooting

### Persona doesn't match description

- Be more specific about age, expression, attire
- Provide reference images of the "type" you want
- Try: "NOT a stock photo feeling, more natural and authentic"

### Journey map is too complex

- Reduce to 5-6 stages maximum
- Request "simplified, high-level view"
- Save detailed journeys for separate deep-dive slides

### Wireframe looks too polished

- Explicitly request "low-fidelity wireframe"
- Ask for "grayscale only, no polish"
- Specify "sketch-like, not final design"

### Device mockup looks fake

- Request "photorealistic device frame"
- Add context: "slight shadow and reflection"
- Try different angles


## What's Next?

You've mastered user and product visuals. Next up: strategy and architecture diagrams for stakeholder meetings.

**Module 3.2.2** covers system architecture diagrams, prioritization matrices, and product roadmaps - the visuals for CTO, CEO, and board meetings.
