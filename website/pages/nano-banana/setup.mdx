## 3.0: Setup & Download

- **Time to Complete:** 5 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Cursor installed, Google account

## What is Nano Banana?

Nano Banana teaches you to generate professional images using **Gemini 3 Pro Preview** (codenamed "Nano Banana Pro") - Google's most advanced image generation model. But this isn't just a course about prompting an image generator.

**This is a Cursor course.**

You'll learn to build a complete image generation workflow where Cursor:
- **Runs your generations** - Execute image requests directly from your terminal
- **Batches multiple images** - Generate variants and iterations in parallel
- **Manages your files** - Organize outputs, name them intelligently, track versions
- **Builds your style library** - Create and maintain reusable style definitions
- **Iterates with you** - Refine prompts, adjust parameters, and improve results conversationally

By the end of this course, you'll be able to create:
- **Persona portraits** and lifestyle shots
- **Journey maps** and user flow visualizations
- **Wireframes** and device mockups
- **Architecture diagrams** and strategy frameworks
- **Marketing assets** and launch graphics

**Key insight:** You're not just learning to generate images - you're building a professional creative pipeline powered by Cursor that compounds over time. The workflow matters as much as the output.


## Before You Start

**You'll need:**
- Cursor installed and working
- A Google account
- A payment method for Google Cloud billing

**About cost:** Gemini 3 Pro charges ~$0.10 per image. The entire course costs less than $5 total. The AI will walk you through setting up billing in the first module.


## Download and Start

**Open your terminal and run:**

```bash
cd ~/Documents && \
curl -L https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-pm-course/releases/download/nano-banana-v1.0/nano-banana.zip -o nano-banana.zip && \
unzip nano-banana.zip -d nano-banana && \
cd nano-banana && \
cursor .
```

**What this does:**
1. Navigates to your Documents folder
2. Downloads the Nano Banana module files
3. Extracts them to `nano-banana`
4. Navigates into the folder
5. Opens Cursor in the nano-banana folder

Then type `/start-3-1-1` in the chat to begin!


## Alternative: Manual Download

If the command above doesn't work:

1. Download the zip from the [Nano Banana Release Page](https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-pm-course/releases/tag/nano-banana-v1.0)
2. Extract it to your Documents folder
3. Open your terminal and run:
```bash
cd ~/Documents/nano-banana && cursor .
```
4. Type `/start-3-1-1` to begin


## What You'll Learn

**Module 3.1: Introduction to Image Generation**
- 3.1.1: Welcome & First Generation - Set up your API key and generate your first image
- 3.1.2: Understanding the Basics - Parameters, aspect ratios, resolution, iteration
- 3.1.3: Consistency & Style - Golden Rules of prompting, reference images, variants
- 3.1.4: Building Your Style Database - Create a reusable library of styles

**Module 3.2: PM Use Cases**
- 3.2.1: Users & Product Visuals - Personas, journey maps, wireframes, mockups
- 3.2.2: Strategy & Architecture - Diagrams, matrices, roadmaps
- 3.2.3: Marketing & Launch Assets - App store graphics, ads, announcements


## Troubleshooting

### curl or unzip not found

**Mac:** Run `xcode-select --install` in your terminal to install command line tools.

**Windows:** Download the zip manually from the release page (link above), extract it, then navigate to the folder and run `claude`.

### Download fails

Try downloading manually from the [release page](https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-pm-course/releases/tag/nano-banana-v1.0) and extracting to your Documents folder.

### Cursor doesn't recognize /start commands

Make sure you're running Cursor from inside the `nano-banana` folder. The slash commands only work when the AI has access to the module files.


## What's Next?

Once Cursor is running inside the `nano-banana` folder:

**Type:** `/start-3-1-1`

The AI will guide you through:
- Getting your Gemini API key
- Setting up billing
- Generating your first image

The entire setup takes about 5 minutes, and you'll have your first AI-generated image before you know it.
