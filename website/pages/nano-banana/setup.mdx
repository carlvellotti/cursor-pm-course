## 3.0: Setup & Download

- **Time to Complete:** 5 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Course files downloaded, Google account

## What is Nano Banana?

Nano Banana teaches you to generate professional images using **Gemini 3 Pro Preview** (codenamed "Nano Banana Pro") - Google's most advanced image generation model. But this isn't just a course about prompting an image generator.

**This is a Cursor course.**

You'll learn to build a complete image generation workflow where Cursor:
- **Runs your generations** - Execute image requests directly from your terminal
- **Batches multiple images** - Generate variants and iterations in parallel
- **Manages your files** - Organize outputs, name them intelligently, track versions
- **Builds your style library** - Create and maintain reusable style definitions
- **Iterates with you** - Refine prompts, adjust parameters, and improve results conversationally

By the end of this module, you'll be able to create:
- **Persona portraits** and lifestyle shots
- **Journey maps** and user flow visualizations
- **Wireframes** and device mockups
- **Architecture diagrams** and strategy frameworks
- **Marketing assets** and launch graphics

**Key insight:** You're not just learning to generate images - you're building a professional creative pipeline powered by Cursor that compounds over time. The workflow matters as much as the output.


## Already Have the Course Files?

**Nano Banana is included in the main course download!** If you've already downloaded and set up the course (Module 0), you're ready to go.

**To start Nano Banana:**
1. Open your `cursor-pm-course` folder in Cursor
2. Open Composer (`Cmd+I` or `Ctrl+I`)
3. Type `/start-3-1-1` and press Enter

The module will guide you through getting your Gemini API key and generating your first image.

## Before You Start Module 3

**You'll need:**
- Course files downloaded and opened in Cursor
- A Google account
- A payment method for Google Cloud billing

**About cost:** Gemini 3 Pro charges ~$0.10 per image. The entire module costs less than $5 total. The first lesson will walk you through setting up billing.

## Troubleshooting

### Slash commands don't appear

Make sure you're running Cursor from the `cursor-pm-course` folder (not a subfolder). The slash commands only work when Cursor has access to the `.cursor/commands/` directory.

### "Module not found" error

You may have an older version of the course. [Download the latest version](https://github.com/carlvellotti/cursor-pm-course/releases/latest/download/complete-course.zip) to get all modules including Nano Banana.


## What's Next?

**Type:** `/start-3-1-1` in Composer

The AI will guide you through:
- Getting your Gemini API key
- Setting up billing
- Generating your first image

The entire setup takes about 5 minutes, and you'll have your first AI-generated image before you know it.
