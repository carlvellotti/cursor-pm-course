## 3.1.2: Understanding the Basics

- **Time to Complete:** 15 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** API key set up (Module 3.1.1)

> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-3-1-2` to begin the interactive experience.

## Overview

Module 3.1.2 teaches you the mechanics of image generation - how the system works and what you can control. You'll understand the `generate()` function, learn about aspect ratios and resolution, and master the art of iteration.

**Key takeaway:** You don't need to memorize parameters or write code. Describe what you want naturally, and Claude picks smart defaults. But understanding what's possible helps you get better results.


## How Generation Works

When you ask Claude to generate an image:

1. **You describe** what you want in natural language
2. **Claude translates** your request into API parameters
3. **The `generate()` function** sends the request to Gemini
4. **Gemini generates** the image (10-15 seconds)
5. **The image saves** to your `outputs/` folder
6. **Claude tells you** where to find it

You never touch the API directly. Claude handles everything.


## The `generate()` Function

All image generation flows through `image_gen.py`. Here are the key parameters:

| Parameter | What it controls | Default |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| `prompt` | Your description of the image | Required |
| `reference_images` | Photos to use as visual input | None |
| `aspect_ratio` | Shape of the output image | 1:1 |
| `resolution` | Size/quality of the output | 1K |

### Two Ways to Work

**Option 1: Let Claude decide**
```
Generate a professional headshot of a product manager
```
Claude picks sensible defaults (1:1 for headshots, 1K for drafts).

**Option 2: Specify what you want**
```
Generate a professional headshot, 16:9 aspect ratio, 2K resolution
```
Claude honors your explicit requests.

Both approaches work great. Start with Option 1, get specific when needed.


## Aspect Ratios

Aspect ratio is the shape of your image. Choose based on where you'll use it.

| Ratio | Shape | Best for |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **1:1** | Square | Profile pics, Instagram posts, icons |
| **16:9** | Wide landscape | Presentations, YouTube thumbnails, hero images |
| **9:16** | Tall portrait | Instagram/TikTok stories, phone wallpapers |
| **4:5** | Tall rectangle | Instagram feed posts |
| **3:2** | Classic photo | Traditional photography ratio |
| **4:3** | Standard | Older presentations, tablets |
| **21:9** | Ultra-wide | Cinematic, banners |

### Quick Reference

- **Presentation slide?** → 16:9
- **Social media post?** → 1:1 or 4:5
- **Phone mockup?** → 9:16
- **Website hero?** → 16:9 or 21:9
- **Profile picture?** → 1:1


## Resolution

Resolution determines size and detail level. It does NOT affect creative quality - just pixel dimensions.

| Resolution | Dimensions | Generation time | Best for |
|------------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| **1K** | 1024px | ~20 seconds | Drafts, iteration, exploration |
| **2K** | 2048px | ~30 seconds | Final outputs, presentations |
| **4K** | 4096px | ~45 seconds | Print, large displays |

### Resolution Strategy

**Use 1K while iterating.** It's faster, costs the same, and lets you explore more quickly.

**Use 2K for final versions.** Once you're happy with the creative direction, regenerate at higher resolution.

**Use 4K only for print.** Unless you're printing at large scale, 4K is overkill.


## Iteration: The Core Workflow

Iteration is the most important concept in image generation. Instead of hoping to get it right on the first try, you refine step by step.

### Why Iteration Works

Gemini is a "thinking model" - it maintains context across the conversation. When you say "make it bluer," it knows what "it" refers to and what you've discussed before.

**Single-shot approach (frustrating):**
```
Generate the perfect image → Hope it's right → Start over if not
```

**Iterative approach (effective):**
```
Generate first draft → "Add more contrast" → "Move the text higher" → "Perfect"
```

### How to Iterate

After Claude generates an image, just ask for changes:

- "Make the background darker"
- "Add a subtle shadow"
- "Change the text to say 'Launch Day'"
- "Make it feel more professional"
- "Try a warmer color palette"

Claude continues the session with Gemini, and your changes build on the previous image.

### When to Start Fresh

Sometimes iteration isn't the right move:

- **Major direction change** → Start fresh with `new_session()`
- **Completely different subject** → Start fresh
- **Want to explore alternatives** → Generate variants (covered in 3.1.3)

Tell Claude "start a new session" or "let's try something completely different" and it will begin fresh.


## Sessions Explained

A **session** is a conversation with Gemini that maintains context. Here's how it works:

**Within a session:**
- Gemini remembers previous generations
- You can reference "the image" or "it"
- Edits build on previous versions
- "Thought signatures" preserve reasoning

**Between sessions:**
- Fresh start
- No memory of previous work
- Good for new projects or directions

### Session Management

Claude handles sessions automatically, but you can control them:

| What you want | What to say |
|---------------|-------------|
| Continue refining | Just describe changes |
| Start fresh | "Start a new session" |
| Check status | "What's the current session?" |

**Pro tip:** Sessions work best for linear refinement. If you want to explore multiple directions, use variants (covered in 3.1.3).


## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Presentation Graphic

**You:** "Create a hero image for a presentation about AI productivity"

**Claude generates** a 1:1 image at 1K resolution.

**You:** "Make it 16:9 for my slides"

**Claude regenerates** with correct aspect ratio.

**You:** "Add text that says 'AI for PMs'"

**Claude adds** the text overlay.

**You:** "This is perfect, regenerate at 2K"

**Claude produces** the final high-resolution version.

### Example 2: Quick Exploration

**You:** "Generate a user persona portrait - corporate vibe"

**Claude generates** first version.

**You:** "Try a more casual look"

**Claude refines** the style.

**You:** "Actually let's start fresh - try illustrated style instead"

**Claude starts new session** and generates illustrated version.


## Best Practices

### Do:
- **Start at 1K resolution** for faster iteration
- **Be specific about changes** - "make the sky more orange" beats "improve it"
- **Let Claude pick defaults** when you don't have strong preferences
- **Build incrementally** - small changes are more predictable

### Don't:
- **Don't start at 4K** - you'll waste time on images you're going to change
- **Don't make multiple changes at once** - iterate one thing at a time
- **Don't be vague** - "make it better" gives Claude nothing to work with
- **Don't abandon good images** - iterate instead of starting over


## Troubleshooting

### Changes aren't being applied

- Make sure you're being specific about what to change
- Try rephrasing: "change the background color to navy blue" instead of "different background"
- The session may have gotten confused - start fresh

### Aspect ratio looks wrong

- Verify you asked for the right ratio (16:9 vs 9:16 is a common mix-up)
- Some compositions work better in certain ratios - Claude may suggest alternatives

### Image quality seems low

- Check resolution - you may be at 1K (which is fine for drafts)
- For final outputs, explicitly ask for 2K resolution

### Generation is slow

- 4K takes ~45 seconds, which feels slow but is normal
- Poor internet can add latency
- High API load can cause delays


## Quick Reference Card

```
Aspect Ratios:
  1:1   → Square (profiles, icons)
  16:9  → Landscape (presentations)
  9:16  → Portrait (stories, mobile)
  4:5   → Tall (Instagram feed)

Resolution:
  1K → Fast drafts
  2K → Final outputs
  4K → Print only

Workflow:
  1. Generate at 1K
  2. Iterate until happy
  3. Regenerate at 2K for final
```


## What's Next?

You understand the mechanics. Now it's time to learn the art.

**Module 3.1.3** teaches the Golden Rules of prompting - how to write descriptions that get amazing results. You'll also learn about reference images and generating variants.
