## 3.2.3: Marketing & Launch Assets

- **Time to Complete:** 20 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Strategy & Architecture Visuals (Module 3.2.2)

> **Start this module in Cursor:** Run `/start-3-2-3` to begin the interactive experience.

## Overview

Module 3.2.3 completes your product visual toolkit with marketing and launch assets. App store graphics, social ads, launch announcements - the visuals that introduce your product to the world.

**Key takeaway:** Marketing visuals communicate value instantly. A great launch graphic can generate excitement that paragraphs of text cannot.


## The Scenario

TaskFlow Mobile got the green light. It's launching next month. Marketing needs assets:

1. **App store hero** - The feature graphic users see in the store
2. **Social ad creative** - Campaign assets for LinkedIn/social
3. **Launch announcement** - The "we're here" moment graphic

Let's build each one.


## App Store Feature Graphics

### What They Are

### Platform Specifications

| Platform | Recommended sizes | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **LinkedIn** | 1200×627 (landscape), 1080×1080 (square) | Professional B2B audience |
| **Twitter/X** | 1200×675 (landscape), 1080×1080 (square) | Quick engagement |

Square format (1:1).
```

### Ad Creative Patterns

| **Data/Stats** | Numbers with visual impact | Credibility building |
| **Testimonial** | Quote with person | Social proof |

### Pro Tips

- **Hook in 1 second:** The image must communicate value instantly

- **Use contrast:** Stand out in a feed full of content
- **Generate multiple variants:** A/B testing is standard practice


## Launch Announcement Graphics

![Launch announcement example - gradient style](/images/nano-banana/announcement-launch-gradient.png)

### When to Use

- Product launch day
- Major feature releases

```

Hero shot of the app - polished, premium feel.
Launch/announcement energy - could be spotlight effect,
subtle motion, or clean reveal aesthetic.
Professional enough for press release, exciting enough for social.
16:9 aspect ratio.
```

### Key Elements

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Product hero** | The thing being launched |
| **Announcement energy** | Excitement, newness, momentum |
| **Text space** | Room for "Introducing..." headline |
| **Brand alignment** | Company colors and style |

### Mood Options

| Mood | Visual approach |
|------|-----------------|
| **Exciting** | Motion blur, dynamic angles, bright colors |
| **Premium** | Clean, minimal, sophisticated lighting |
| **Innovative** | Futuristic, tech-forward, bold |
| **Trustworthy** | Stable, professional, reassuring |

### Pro Tips

- **Make it feel like an event:** This isn't just another graphic
- **Center the product:** The hero should be unmistakable
- **Generate multiple versions:** Different platforms need different formats
- **Think about text overlay:** Leave room for headlines and dates


## Complete Launch Asset Kit

Here's a complete set for a product launch:

### App Store Presence
- Feature graphic (16:9)
- 5-6 screenshot mockups
- App icon (if needed)

### Social Campaign
- LinkedIn ad creative (square + landscape)
- Twitter/X card image
- Instagram post + story variants

### Announcement Package
- Press release hero (16:9)
- Email header graphic
- Blog post featured image
- Social announcement variants

**Total time:** 30-45 minutes for a complete launch kit.


## Using Your Style Library

Marketing benefits from consistent visual identity.

**Build marketing-specific styles:**
- "Brand Ad Style" - your company's visual language
- "Launch Energy" - dynamic announcement feel
- "App Store Clean" - store listing aesthetic

**Then apply consistently:**
```
Generate LinkedIn ad using style #45 (Brand Ad Style)
Generate announcement using style #52 (Launch Energy)
```


## Best Practices

### Do:
- **Match your brand** - use consistent colors and style
- **Focus on value** - what does the user get?
- **Generate variants** - marketing requires testing
- **Think platform-first** - optimize for where it will appear
- **Keep it simple** - one message per graphic

### Don't:
- **Don't overcrowd** - leave breathing room
- **Don't be generic** - show YOUR product, not stock imagery
- **Don't forget text space** - copy will be added
- **Don't use tiny text** - mobile feeds are small
- **Don't skip variants** - one version is never enough


## Troubleshooting

### Ad doesn't stop the scroll

- Increase contrast and boldness
- Try a more emotional concept
- Make the transformation more dramatic
- Generate completely different variants

### App store graphic looks generic

- Show actual UI, not placeholder screens
- Add context that suggests the use case
- Reference your brand colors explicitly
- Try a lifestyle approach (product in use)

### Launch announcement doesn't feel exciting

- Request "launch energy" or "announcement moment"
- Add dynamic elements (motion blur, spotlight)
- Make the product more prominent
- Generate variants with different moods


## The Bigger Picture

Let's zoom out for a moment.

### What You've Built

Through Nano Banana, you've assembled a professional creative pipeline:

**1. The most powerful image model**
Gemini 3 Pro generates photorealistic images, transforms references, handles text overlays, and maintains consistency across generations.

**2. The most powerful AI assistant**
Cursor handles all the technical complexity - API calls, session management, file saving. You focus on creative direction.

**3. A compounding system**
Your style library grows with every project. What took exploration now takes one command: "use style #12."

### The Difference

Most people use AI image tools as novelties:
- Generate random images
- Use once
- Start over

You have a professional pipeline:
- Generate with intention
- Build reusable styles
- Compound over time

That's the difference between using AI occasionally and having AI as a creative superpower.
