# Module 1.5: Three Interaction Modes
## Reference Guide

- **Time to Complete:** 25 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Module 1.4 (Slash Commands)

> **Start this module in Cursor:** Run `/start-1-5` to begin the interactive lesson.

## 📖 Overview

Cursor has three AI modes: Ask (read-only analysis), Agent (autonomous execution), and Plan (research and structured planning). Switch between them to match your workflow.

**Key takeaway:** Ask explores safely, Agent executes work, Plan structures complex projects.

## The Three Modes

### Ask Mode (Read-Only)

**What it does:**
- Reads and analyzes files without making changes
- Answers questions about codebase structure
- Provides safe exploration of unfamiliar files

**When to use it:**
- Exploring new documentation or codebases
- Need analysis without risk of accidental changes
- Planning before committing to an approach

**Example:** "Explain what PRODUCT.md contains" - Cursor reads and summarizes without creating files.

### Agent Mode (Autonomous Execution)

**What it does:**
- Reads AND writes files
- Runs terminal commands
- Makes changes across multiple files
- Iterates and fixes errors

**When to use it:**
- 80% of your daily PM work
- Creating files and implementing features
- Anything hands-on and tactical

**Example:** "Create a PRD for dark mode feature" - Cursor writes the file, adds sections, formats it.

This is the **default mode** and what you've been using in all previous modules.

### Plan Mode (Structured Planning)

**What it does:**
- Researches context files automatically
- Performs web searches for competitive/market data
- Asks clarifying questions
- Creates structured plan documents
- Executes plan after your approval

**When to use it:**
- Complex multi-step projects
- Coordinating across teams or channels
- Need stakeholder buy-in before execution
- "Measure twice, cut once" situations

**Workflow:**
1. You give complex request
2. Cursor researches files and web
3. Cursor asks clarifying questions
4. Cursor generates structured PLAN document
5. You review and iterate on plan
6. Click "Build" to execute

**Example:** "Plan a multi-channel product launch" - Cursor researches your company context, asks about priority segments and timeline, creates launch plan with messaging/timeline/metrics, waits for approval, then builds all documents.

## Mode Comparison

| Feature | Ask | Agent | Plan |
|---------|-----|-------|------|
| **Read files** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Write files** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ (after approval) |
| **Run commands** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ (after approval) |
| **Web search** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Ask questions** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Create structured plan** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Best for** | Exploring | Executing | Planning |
| **Usage %** | 5% | 80% | 15% |

## Switching Modes

Three ways to switch:

1. **Click the mode picker** (lower left of chat box)
2. **Press Cmd/Ctrl + .** (Command/Control + period)
3. **Press Shift + Tab**

Current mode always displays in the chat interface.

## PM Use Cases

### Ask Mode
- "What does this competitive landscape file contain?"
- "Explain the structure of these meeting notes"
- "Summarize the personas without changing anything"

### Agent Mode
- "Write a PRD for the onboarding redesign"
- "Process these 10 customer interview transcripts"
- "Create a competitive matrix from these files"

### Plan Mode
- "Plan a multi-channel product launch campaign"
- "Research competitors and create a positioning strategy"
- "Build a complete go-to-market plan for enterprise customers"

**Decision framework:**
- Simple task, clear approach → **Agent**
- Unfamiliar territory, need to look around → **Ask**
- Complex project, multiple stakeholders, need structure → **Plan**

## Plan Mode Deep Dive

### Key Capabilities

**Web search:** Cursor can research competitors, pricing models, market trends - anything online.

**Clarifying questions:** Cursor asks about:
- Target audience priorities
- Timeline constraints
- Channel preferences
- Success metrics

**Iterative planning:** Edit the plan before execution:
- "Add webinar to the campaign"
- "Focus on enterprise first"
- "Include social media channels"

**Execution tracking:** Watch progress as Cursor builds each deliverable.

### Typical Plan Mode Session

1. **You:** "Plan a multi-channel launch for real-time collaboration feature. Research our positioning, competitors, and target customers."
2. **Cursor researches:** Reads PRODUCT.md, PERSONAS.md, competitive-positioning.md, performs web searches
3. **Cursor asks:** "Which customer segment first?" "Timeline?" "Email or in-app priority?"
4. **You answer:** "Enterprise first, 2-week beta then 4-week launch, coordinated simultaneous"
5. **Cursor creates PLAN:** Shows what it will build (campaign plan, timeline, messaging)
6. **You review:** "Add sales enablement section"
7. **Cursor updates plan**
8. **You approve:** Click "Build"
9. **Cursor executes:** Creates all documents following the plan

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Can't find mode picker"
**Fix:** Look in the lower left of the chat input box. You'll see "Ask", "Agent", or "Plan" displayed.

### "Plan mode not asking questions"
**Fix:** Make your request more complex. Plan mode asks questions for multi-step projects, not simple tasks.

### "Web search not working in Plan mode"
**Fix:** Ensure you're on Cursor Pro trial or subscription. Web search requires Pro features.

### "Plan created but Build button missing"
**Fix:** Scroll down in the plan document. The Build button appears at the bottom after the full plan is generated.
