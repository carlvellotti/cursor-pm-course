# Module 1.2: Using Cursor's Interface
## Reference Guide

- **Time to Complete:** 20-25 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Cursor installed (Module 0.1)

> **Start this module in Cursor:** Run `/start-1-2` to begin the interactive lesson.

## Overview

Cursor has three main workflows for working with AI: **Chat** (quick questions), **Composer** (multi-file edits), and **Cmd K** (inline edits). Learn when to use each one and how to reference files with @ mentions.

**Key takeaway:** Chat for exploration, Composer for creation, Cmd K for quick fixes.

## The Three-Pane Layout

Cursor's workspace has three main areas:

- **Left:** File explorer (Cmd/Ctrl+B to toggle)
- **Middle:** Editor pane (where you write and view files)
- **Right:** AI Pane (Chat or Composer - where you talk to Claude)

You can also open a terminal at the bottom with Ctrl+` (backtick).

## The Three Workflows

### Chat (Cmd+L)

**What it does:** Opens a sidebar for quick questions and exploration. Think of it as asking a colleague for help.

**When to use:**
- Asking questions about code or files
- Quick explanations
- Exploring ideas before committing
- Analyzing existing content

**How it works:**
- Opens in the right sidebar
- Doesn't automatically edit files (you review suggestions first)
- Best for one-off questions

### Composer (Cmd+I)

**What it does:** Opens a full panel for creating or editing multiple files at once. Think of it as collaborative document editing.

**When to use:**
- Writing PRDs, specs, or documentation
- Creating new files from scratch
- Editing multiple related files
- Complex tasks requiring planning

**How it works:**
- Opens as a full panel (can be opened as a tab or sidebar)
- Can edit multiple files in one session
- Shows diffs before applying changes
- Best for substantial work

### Cmd K (Inline Editing)

**What it does:** Quick inline edits right where your cursor is. Think of it as a smart find-and-replace.

**When to use:**
- Fixing typos
- Rephrasing sentences
- Quick tactical edits
- Single-file changes

**How it works:**
- Press Cmd/Ctrl+K with cursor in a file
- Type instruction (e.g., "fix this typo")
- Shows diff inline
- Scoped to current file only

## Quick Comparison Table

| Workflow | Shortcut | Scope | Best For | Edits Files? |
|----------|----------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Chat** | Cmd+L | Single/multiple files | Questions, analysis | No (suggests only) |
| **Composer** | Cmd+I | Multiple files | Creating, planning, multi-file edits | Yes (with review) |
| **Cmd K** | Cmd+K | Current file only | Quick fixes, rephrasing | Yes (inline) |

## Referencing Files with @ Mentions

There are three ways to give Claude context about files:

### 1. @ Mentions (Most Common)

Type `@` in the chat input to bring up context options:

- `@Files` - Reference specific files (e.g., `@PRD.md`)
- `@Folders` - Reference entire folders (e.g., `@company-context`)
- `@Web` - Search the web for context
- `@Code` - Reference code symbols
- `@Git` - Reference Git commits or branches

**Example:** "Tell me about @COMPANY.md"

### 2. Drag Files

Click and drag files from the file explorer directly into the chat input box. Creates the same file reference as @ mentions.

**When to use:** When you're already browsing files and prefer a visual approach.

### 3. "Add to Chat" (Specific Text)

Highlight text in the editor, then click "Add to Chat" button that appears. Use this for quoting specific sections, not entire files.

**When to use:** Referencing user feedback quotes, specific excerpts, or particular paragraphs.

## Markdown Preview & Editing

**Preview Mode:** Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+V to toggle between raw Markdown and formatted preview.

**WYSIWYG Editor (Optional):**
1. Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → "Extensions: Install Extensions"
2. Search for "Markdown Editor" by zaaack
3. Install it
4. Use Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Alt/Opt+M to edit Markdown like Google Docs

**Note:** WYSIWYG editor is optional - preview mode works fine for most PM work.

## AI Model Selector

Located at the bottom of the AI Pane (Chat or Composer). Click the dropdown to switch between models (Claude Sonnet, GPT-4, etc.).

**Recommendation:** Use the latest Claude Sonnet model for PM work. It's the best balance of quality and speed. You'll rarely hit usage limits doing PRDs and documentation.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Mac | Windows |
|--------|-----|---------|
| Open Chat | Cmd+L | Ctrl+L |
| Open Composer | Cmd+I | Ctrl+I |
| Inline Edit | Cmd+K | Ctrl+K |
| Toggle File Explorer | Cmd+B | Ctrl+B |
| Markdown Preview | Cmd+Shift+V | Ctrl+Shift+V |
| Command Palette | Cmd+Shift+P | Ctrl+Shift+P |
| Open Terminal | Ctrl+` | Ctrl+` |

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't see the AI Pane"
**Fix:** Press Cmd/Ctrl+L to open Chat or Cmd/Ctrl+I to open Composer.

### "@ mentions aren't showing up"
**Fix:** Make sure you're typing in the chat input box (not the editor). Type `@` and wait a moment for the menu to appear.

### "Markdown preview isn't working"
**Fix:** Make sure you have a `.md` file open in the editor, then press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+V. Only works with Markdown files.

### "Cmd K does nothing"
**Fix:** Make sure your cursor is actively in a file in the editor (click in the file first), then press Cmd/Ctrl+K.
