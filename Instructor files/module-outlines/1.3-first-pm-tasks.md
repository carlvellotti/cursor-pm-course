# Module 1.3: Your First PM Tasks: @ Mentions & File Operations

## Files Needed to Start
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/meeting-notes-raw.md` *(port from ccforpms 1.3)*
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/product-sync-notes.md` *(port from ccforpms 1.3)*
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/user-interviews/user-interview-01.md` through `08.md` *(port from ccforpms 1.3)*

## Files Created During Module
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/meeting-notes-raw.md` (edited - summary appended to bottom of existing file)
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/product-sync-email.md` (product-sync-notes transformed into executive email format)
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/user-research-insights.md` (synthesis of 8 interviews in new file)

## High-Level Overview
- **Scenario 1: Append to Existing File** - Use @ mention or "Add to Chat" on `meeting-notes-raw.md`, ask Cursor to append a summary section to the bottom of the same file
- Introduce Apply/Reject workflow (review changes before accepting – usually Accept All is fine)
- Teaches: editing existing files in-place
- **Scenario 2: Transform to New File** - Use @ mention on `product-sync-notes.md`, ask Cursor to create a separate executive email summary in new file `product-sync-email.md`
- Practice Apply/Reject again (review before accepting)
- Teaches: reading one file, creating new formatted output
- **Scenario 3: Folder Analysis to New File** - Use @ mention on `user-interviews/` folder (8 files), create insights document synthesizing all interviews
- Teaches: multi-file analysis, folder-level operations
- Validate learning (what summary was appended? what's in the email? what's the #1 pain point from interviews?)

## Teaching Flow

- Welcome to Module 1.3: Your First PM Tasks
- In Module 1.2 you learned the Cursor interface - file explorer, AI Pane, @ mentions
- Now you're going to use those skills for REAL PM work
- No practice exercises - actual tasks PMs do every day
- STOP: Ready to do some real work?
- USER: Yes / Ready

---

- Today you'll learn three common PM workflows
- First: Taking messy meeting notes and cleaning them up
- Second: Transforming notes into polished deliverables
- Third: Analyzing multiple files to find insights
- These are things you'll do constantly as a PM
- STOP: Sound good?
- USER: Confirms

---

- **Scenario 1: Append to Existing File**
- Imagine: You just got out of a product strategy meeting
- You took rough notes during the call - they're a bit messy
- You need to add a clean summary to the bottom of those notes for your team
- Let's do that now
- In the file explorer, find lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/meeting-notes-raw.md
- STOP: Do you see it?
- USER: Yes

---

- Great! Open it and skim through it
- These are realistic rough notes - typos, incomplete thoughts, stream of consciousness
- STOP: Tell me: what was this meeting about in one sentence?
- USER: Describes meeting topic
- Exactly! Now let's add a professional summary to the bottom

---

- STOP: Type this command: "Read @meeting-notes-raw.md and append a clean summary section to the bottom of the file"
- USER: Types and sends command
- ACTION: Read the file and append summary section
- Perfect! Look at what just happened in the AI Pane

---

- You should see me proposing changes to meeting-notes-raw.md
- This is the **Apply/Reject workflow** - super important for PMs
- You can review each change before accepting it
- For most PM tasks, "Accept All" is totally fine
- But you CAN reject specific changes if something looks wrong
- STOP: Do you see the proposed changes?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Go ahead and click "Accept All" (or review and accept individually if you prefer)
- STOP: Did the changes get applied?
- USER: Confirms
- Awesome! Open meeting-notes-raw.md in the editor to see the new summary at the bottom
- STOP: What's different about the file now?
- USER: Describes summary being appended
- Perfect! That's workflow #1: editing existing files in-place

---

- **Scenario 2: Transform to New File**
- New scenario: You have notes from a product sync meeting
- You need to send an executive summary email to your VP
- You don't want to edit the original notes - you want a NEW file in email format
- Let's do that

---

- In the file explorer, find lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/product-sync-notes.md
- STOP: Do you see it?
- USER: Yes
- Great! Don't open it - we'll just @ mention it
- STOP: Type this: "Read @product-sync-notes.md and create a new file called product-sync-email.md formatted as an executive email summary"
- USER: Types and sends command

---

- ACTION: Read product-sync-notes.md and create product-sync-email.md
- Now watch - I'm creating a BRAND NEW file, not editing the existing one
- You should see the Apply/Reject workflow again
- This time for creating a new file
- STOP: Do you see the new file being proposed?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Accept the changes
- STOP: Done?
- USER: Confirms
- Now look in your file explorer - you should see product-sync-email.md appear
- STOP: Do you see the new file?
- USER: Confirms
- Open it up - see how it's formatted as a polished email, not rough notes?
- STOP: What's the key difference from Scenario 1?
- USER: Describes (new file vs editing existing)
- Exactly! Same input (notes), different output format (email)

---

- **Scenario 3: Folder Analysis to New File**
- Final scenario: You conducted 8 user interviews this week
- Each interview is in a separate file
- You need to synthesize all 8 into one insights document
- This is where @ mentions get REALLY powerful

---

- In the file explorer, find lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/user-interviews/
- Expand that folder
- STOP: How many interview files do you see?
- USER: 8 files
- Exactly! You could @ mention each file individually... but there's a better way
- You can @ mention the ENTIRE FOLDER
- STOP: Type this: "Analyze all files in @user-interviews and create a new file called user-research-insights.md with the top 3 pain points and supporting quotes"
- USER: Types and sends command

---

- ACTION: Read all 8 interview files and create synthesis document
- Watch - I'm reading all 8 files and synthesizing them
- This is HUGE for PMs - you can analyze dozens of files in seconds
- STOP: Do you see the new insights file being proposed?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Accept the changes
- STOP: Done?
- USER: Confirms
- Open user-research-insights.md in the editor
- This is a synthesis of 8 separate interviews
- STOP: What's the #1 pain point mentioned?
- USER: Describes top pain point
- Perfect! You just did multi-file analysis

---

- Let's recap what you learned
- Scenario 1: Append to existing file (in-place editing)
- Scenario 2: Transform to new file (read one, create another)
- Scenario 3: Folder analysis (read many, synthesize one)
- These three patterns cover 80% of PM work in Cursor
- STOP: Which scenario do you think you'll use most?
- USER: Answers

---

- Here's the key insight: @ mentions + clear instructions = powerful PM workflows
- You can edit existing docs, create new formatted outputs, or analyze multiple files
- The Apply/Reject workflow lets you review before accepting
- In practice, you'll mostly Accept All for PM tasks
- STOP: Any questions about these workflows?
- USER: Questions or confirms

---

- Fantastic! You just did real PM work
- You cleaned up meeting notes, created an executive email, and synthesized user research
- In Module 1.4, you'll learn how to use templates for consistent formatting
- STOP: Ready to move on?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Perfect! You're ready for Module 1.4
- When you're ready for the next module, open a new tab in this AI Pane and type: /start-1-4
- See you there!
