# Module 1.3: Your First PM Tasks: @ Mentions & File Operations

## Files Needed to Start
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/meeting-notes-raw.md` *(port from ccforpms 1.3)*
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/product-sync-notes.md` *(port from ccforpms 1.3)*
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/user-interviews/user-interview-01.md` through `08.md` *(port from ccforpms 1.3)*

## Files Created During Module
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/meeting-notes-raw.md` (edited - summary appended to bottom of existing file)
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/product-sync-email.md` (product-sync-notes transformed into executive email format)
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/user-research-insights.md` (synthesis of 8 interviews in new file)

## High-Level Overview
- **Scenario 1: Append to Existing File** - Use @ mention or "Add to Chat" on `meeting-notes-raw.md`, ask Cursor to append a summary section to the bottom of the same file
- Introduce Apply/Reject workflow (review changes before accepting – usually Accept All is fine)
- Teaches: editing existing files in-place
- **Scenario 2: Transform to New File** - Use @ mention on `product-sync-notes.md`, ask Cursor to create a separate executive email summary in new file `product-sync-email.md`
- Practice Apply/Reject again (review before accepting)
- Teaches: reading one file, creating new formatted output
- **Scenario 3: Folder Analysis to New File** - Use @ mention on `user-interviews/` folder (8 files), create insights document synthesizing all interviews
- Teaches: multi-file analysis, folder-level operations
- Validate learning (what summary was appended? what's in the email? what's the #1 pain point from interviews?)
