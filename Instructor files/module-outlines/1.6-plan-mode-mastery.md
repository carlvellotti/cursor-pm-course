# Module 1.6: Plan Mode Mastery

## Files Needed to Start
- `lesson-modules/1.6-plan-mode/feature-announcement.md` (new feature to launch - e.g., real-time collaboration)
- `lesson-modules/1.6-plan-mode/target-customers.md` (customer segments and feedback)
- `lesson-modules/1.6-plan-mode/competitive-positioning.md` (how competitors message similar features)
- `company-context/PRODUCT.md` (for product context)
- `company-context/PERSONAS.md` (for audience targeting)

## Files Created During Module
- `lesson-modules/1.6-plan-mode/launch-campaign-plan.md` (comprehensive go-to-market plan created in Plan Mode)
- `lesson-modules/1.6-plan-mode/launch-timeline.md` (execution timeline with owners)

## High-Level Overview
- Introduce Plan Mode as Cursor's killer feature (superior to Claude Code's planning)
- Explain Shift+Tab workflow to activate Plan Mode
- Demonstrate Plan Mode phases (research → clarify → plan → edit → execute)
- **Scenario: Plan a product launch campaign** (not coding - pure PM work)
- Need to coordinate: messaging, email sequences, in-app announcements, blog post, sales enablement, support docs, success metrics
- Reference multiple context files: feature details, customer feedback, competitive positioning, personas
- Cursor researches context and asks clarifying questions ("Which customer segment first?" "Email or in-app priority?" "Timeline constraints?")
- Student answers questions interactively
- Cursor generates structured multi-channel launch plan with timeline
- Practice editing the plan collaboratively (adjust messaging, reorder steps, add channels)
- Execute plan to create launch documents (or save plan for later)
- Explain when to use Plan Mode (complex multi-step work requiring coordination across teams/channels)
