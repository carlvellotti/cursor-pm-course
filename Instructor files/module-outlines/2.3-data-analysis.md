# Module 2.3: Product Strategy

## Files Needed to Start
- `lesson-modules/2.3-product-strategy/frameworks/rumelt-strategy-kernel.md` *(port from Claude Code course)*
- `lesson-modules/2.3-product-strategy/frameworks/gibson-biddle-dhm.md` *(port from Claude Code course)*
- `lesson-modules/2.3-product-strategy/frameworks/swot-analysis.md` *(port from Claude Code course)*
- `lesson-modules/2.3-product-strategy/methods/devils-advocate-strategy.md` *(port from Claude Code course)*
- `lesson-modules/2.3-product-strategy/presentation-best-practices.md` *(copy from Instructor files/research_presentation_best_practices.md)*

## Files Created During Module
- `lesson-modules/2.3-product-strategy/h1-2026-ai-product-strategy.md` (complete strategy using Rumelt's Kernel)
- `lesson-modules/2.3-product-strategy/strategy-review-slides.md` *(Cursor alternative to .pptx - structured markdown slides)*

## High-Level Overview
- **Show overall workflow:** Display Mermaid diagram showing strategy development flow (Framework → Research → Choices → Synthesis → Presentation)
- **File orientation:** Walk through frameworks folder:
  - `rumelt-strategy-kernel.md` (what we'll use today - Diagnosis → Guiding Policy → Coherent Actions)
  - `gibson-biddle-dhm.md` (optional advanced: Delight, Hard to Copy, Margin-enhancing)
  - `swot-analysis.md` (optional advanced: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats)
  - `devils-advocate-strategy.md` (method for challenging choices)
- **Preview the 5 strategic choices:** Show topics upfront so students know what's coming (Focus, Competition, Pricing, Scope, Risk)
- **Phase 1 - Learn Framework:** Review Rumelt's Strategy Kernel (Diagnosis → Guiding Policy → Coherent Actions)
- **Phase 2 - Gather Intelligence:**
  - Review strategic situation as Gen AI PM at TaskFlow (2 engineers, $50k budget, moderate AI usage)
  - Use web search to research competitive AI landscape with specific prompts:
    - "What AI features has Notion launched in 2025? How are they pricing it?"
    - "What is Linear's AI strategy? What features have they shipped?"
    - "What AI capabilities does Asana offer? Who are they targeting?"
  - Synthesize findings into competitive landscape summary
- **Phase 3 - Make Strategic Choices:** Work through first 2 choices in detail, then make assumptions for remaining 3:
  1. **Focus vs Breadth:** Deep on voice vs spread AI everywhere vs partner for capabilities (full devil's advocate challenge)
  2. **Competitive Response:** Build faster vs differentiate for SMBs vs ignore and focus (full devil's advocate challenge)
  3. **AI Pricing & Business Model:** Assume subsidized (like Linear) - in real work you'd challenge this too
  4. **Product Scope:** Assume AI as enhancement to existing product - in real work you'd challenge this too
  5. **Risk Tolerance:** Assume deliberate/defensible approach - in real work you'd challenge this too
  - After choices 1 and 2, Cursor plays devil's advocate to challenge thinking (@ mention `devils-advocate-strategy.md`)
  - Student can stick with choice or reconsider after challenge
  - For learning purposes, skip full challenges on choices 3-5 and move forward with assumptions
- **Phase 4 - Synthesize Strategy:**
  - Cursor creates `h1-2026-ai-product-strategy.md` using Rumelt's framework
  - Sections: Diagnosis (competitive landscape), Guiding Policy (synthesis of 5 choices), Coherent Actions (H1 2026 roadmap), Critical Assumptions
  - Cursor displays Mermaid diagram in chat illustrating how the 5 choices connect and reinforce each other (visual rendered in Cursor chat)
- **Phase 5 - Create Presentation:**
  - @ mention `presentation-best-practices.md` to learn slide best practices:
    - Action titles (McKinsey/BCG style: declarative statements that tell the insight)
    - One idea per slide
    - 4Ps framework (Problem → Promise → Proof → Proposal)
    - Visual hierarchy and design principles
  - Cursor generates `strategy-review-slides.md` (slide content in markdown format)
  - 12-15 slides covering: Title, Executive Summary, Diagnosis, Competitive Landscape, Strategic Direction, Tradeoffs Made, H1 2026 Roadmap (Q1 and Q2), Success Metrics, Critical Assumptions, Why We'll Win, Risks & Mitigation, The Ask
  - Each slide has: **action title + bullet points** (text only, students add visuals in their presentation tool)
  - Note: Creating slide CONTENT (words) in markdown, not a presentation file - students can copy into PowerPoint/Google Slides/Keynote later
- **Key teaching:** Cursor accelerates strategy development from weeks → 1 hour. Instant competitive research, on-demand devil's advocate challenges, automatic synthesis, and consulting-quality slides. What takes 2-3 weeks traditionally, you do in 60 minutes with Cursor. But YOU still make all the strategic decisions.

## Teaching Flow

- Welcome to Module 2.3: Product Strategy!
- This module teaches you how to use Cursor to develop product strategy 10x faster
- What normally takes 2-3 weeks: competitive research, strategic frameworks, synthesis, exec slides - you'll do in 60 minutes with Cursor
- Here's your scenario: You're the Product Lead for Gen AI at TaskFlow
- You have 2 engineers, $50k budget for H1 2026, and you need to develop an AI product strategy
- The CEO is asking: What's our AI strategy? How do we compete with Notion, Linear, and Asana?
- You'll use Cursor to research competitors, challenge your thinking, and create a complete strategy deck
- STOP: Ready to see how Cursor accelerates strategy development?
- USER: Confirms ready

---

- Let me show you the complete workflow we'll follow
- ACTION: Display Mermaid diagram showing the 5-phase strategy development workflow
	- Phase 1: Learn Framework (Rumelt's Strategy Kernel)
	- Phase 2: Gather Intelligence (competitive research)
	- Phase 3: Make Strategic Choices (5 key decisions with devil's advocate challenges)
	- Phase 4: Synthesize Strategy (create strategy doc)
	- Phase 5: Create Presentation (executive slide deck)
- Great strategy isn't fluffy vision - it's hard choices backed by rigorous thinking
- STOP: Do you see the workflow diagram showing all 5 phases?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Perfect! Let me walk you through the frameworks and methods we'll be using
- ACTION: List files in lesson-modules/2.3-product-strategy/ folder structure
- Here's what we have:
	- frameworks/rumelt-strategy-kernel.md: The framework we'll use today (Diagnosis → Guiding Policy → Coherent Actions)
	- frameworks/gibson-biddle-dhm.md: Optional advanced framework (Delight, Hard to Copy, Margin-enhancing)
	- frameworks/swot-analysis.md: Optional advanced analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
	- methods/devils-advocate-strategy.md: How to challenge your own thinking rigorously
	- presentation-best-practices.md: Consulting-quality slide writing (McKinsey/BCG action titles)
- Today we'll use Rumelt's Strategy Kernel and the devil's advocate method
- The others are here if you want to go deeper later
- STOP: Do you see all these framework files?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Great! Let me preview the strategic choice process
- You'll make 5 strategic choices that define your AI strategy:
	- Choice 1: Focus vs Breadth - Go deep on one AI capability or spread AI across the product?
	- Choice 2: Competitive Response - Build faster to match competitors or differentiate for a niche?
	- Choice 3: AI Pricing & Business Model - Premium tier, subsidize for growth, or usage-based?
	- Choice 4: Product Scope - Is AI the product, an enhancement, or for specific jobs?
	- Choice 5: Risk Tolerance - Move fast, be deliberate, or wait and learn?
- We'll work through choices 1 and 2 in detail - I'll challenge each one hard (devil's advocate) to stress-test your thinking
- For choices 3-5, we'll make assumptions to keep moving (but in real work, you'd challenge those too)
- This isn't comfortable, but it makes strategy much stronger
- STOP: Make sense? Let's learn the framework and then start making choices
- USER: Confirms

---

- Excellent! Let's begin Phase 1: Learn the Framework
- We're using Rumelt's Strategy Kernel - one of the clearest frameworks for product strategy
- STOP: Ask me to say: "Explain the three components of @rumelt-strategy-kernel.md (Diagnosis, Guiding Policy, Coherent Actions)"
- USER: Explain the three components of @rumelt-strategy-kernel.md (Diagnosis, Guiding Policy, Coherent Actions)

---

- ACTION: Read frameworks/rumelt-strategy-kernel.md and extract key concepts
- Done! Here's Rumelt's Strategy Kernel framework:
	- 1. DIAGNOSIS: Define the critical challenge/opportunity you face
		- What's the problem? What's changing in the market?
		- What's the core difficulty?
		- Based on facts, data, competitive landscape
	- 2. GUIDING POLICY: Your overall approach to dealing with the challenge
		- Not specific actions, but the general method
		- Creates competitive advantage
		- Example: "Focus on SMB differentiation" or "Build AI-first from scratch"
	- 3. COHERENT ACTIONS: Concrete steps that implement the guiding policy
		- Specific initiatives, features, investments
		- Must reinforce each other (coherent!)
		- H1 2026 roadmap, resource allocation, partnerships
- The power of this framework: It forces clarity on the hard problem, clear direction, and concrete actions
- STOP: Does the Diagnosis → Guiding Policy → Coherent Actions framework make sense?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Perfect! Now Phase 2: Gather Intelligence
- Before making strategic choices, we need to understand the competitive landscape
- You can't develop strategy in a vacuum - you need to know what competitors are doing
- Let me tell you your strategic situation first:
	- You're the Product Lead for Gen AI at TaskFlow
	- Resources: 2 engineers (both full-stack, no ML specialists), $50k budget for H1 2026
	- Current state: 15% of users have tried AI features, usage is moderate
	- Company priority: Activation and retention (not revenue yet)
	- Target market: Small teams (5-20 people), often first-time PM tool users
- Now let's use Cursor's web search to research what Notion, Linear, and Asana are doing with AI
- This used to require hours of manual googling - with Cursor it's just asking
- STOP: Ready to see Cursor do competitive research?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Let's ask Cursor to research all three competitors at once using web search
- STOP: Ask me to say: "Search the web for Notion, Linear, and Asana's AI features, pricing strategies, and target markets. Then create a competitive landscape comparison table."
- USER: Search the web for Notion, Linear, and Asana's AI features, pricing strategies, and target markets. Then create a competitive landscape comparison table.

---

- ACTION: Web search for all three competitors and synthesize findings
- Done! I researched all three competitors and created a competitive landscape comparison
- Here's what I found:
	- **Notion:**
		- AI Features: Notion AI for writing, Q&A on your docs, auto-fill databases, summaries
		- Pricing: $10/user/month add-on to existing plans (separate from core product)
		- Strategy: Knowledge work automation, especially writing and documentation
		- Target: Knowledge workers at mid-size to large companies
		- Positioning: "AI-powered workspace" - AI is enhancement, not the core product
	- **Linear:**
		- AI Features: Auto-triage issues, generate technical specs from descriptions, suggest labels/assignees
		- Pricing: Included in standard plans (no separate AI pricing yet)
		- Strategy: Engineering workflow automation - focused on reducing PM/eng overhead
		- Target: Engineering teams at startups and scale-ups
		- Positioning: "AI for engineering velocity" - helps teams ship faster
	- **Asana:**
		- AI Features: Smart goals, workload balancing, project risk predictions, workflow recommendations
		- Pricing: Part of Business/Enterprise tiers (not available on free/premium)
		- Strategy: Team coordination and resource optimization - focused on large teams
		- Target: Enterprise PMOs and operations teams
		- Positioning: "AI-powered work management" - helps large orgs coordinate complexity
- **Competitive Landscape Summary:**
	- Notion: Knowledge work + writing, $10/user/month, enterprise knowledge workers
	- Linear: Engineering automation, included free, startup/scale-up eng teams
	- Asana: Enterprise coordination, business tier only, large org PMOs
- Key insight: They're all targeting different segments with different AI capabilities - none focused on SMBs (5-20 person teams)
- See what just happened? Cursor researched 3 competitors and synthesized findings in under 2 minutes
- Normally this competitive research would take 2-3 hours: searching, reading, note-taking, building comparison spreadsheets
- STOP: Do you see the competitive landscape comparison?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Excellent! Phase 2 Gather Intelligence is complete ✓
- Now for Phase 3: Make Strategic Choices
- You'll make 5 key strategic decisions
- After each one, Cursor will challenge it hard as devil's advocate
- You can stick with your choice or reconsider after hearing the challenge
- Let's load the devil's advocate method and Rumelt framework into Cursor
- STOP: Ask me to say: "Help me develop a strategy using @rumelt-strategy-kernel.md and challenge my choices using @devils-advocate-strategy.md"
- USER: Help me develop a strategy using @rumelt-strategy-kernel.md and challenge my choices using @devils-advocate-strategy.md

---

- ACTION: Read methods/devils-advocate-strategy.md
- Done! I've loaded the devil's advocate method
- Here's the power of Cursor: after you make a strategic choice, I'll instantly challenge it
- Like having a strategy consultant on demand - rigorous pushback without the $500/hour fee
- I'll argue the opposite position as strongly as possible, poke holes, surface risks
- It's uncomfortable but it strengthens your thinking before you present to leadership
- In traditional strategy work, you'd schedule meetings with colleagues to pressure-test ideas
- With Cursor, you get instant strategic challenges on every decision
- Ready for Choice 1: Focus vs Breadth?
- STOP: Confirm you're ready
- USER: Confirms

---

- Choice 1: Focus vs Breadth
- Your 2 engineers can either go deep on ONE AI capability or spread thin across many
- STOP: What's your strategic choice? A) Deep focus on voice features (like Siri for tasks) - doubles down on voice chat strength, B) Spread AI across product (smart suggestions everywhere) - matches competitors' breadth, C) Partner for AI capabilities (integrate Notion AI, OpenAI) - leverage others' investment
- USER: Chooses A, B, or C

---

- [If A - Voice Focus] Alright, let me challenge that hard
- Devil's Advocate: Voice is a single interaction mode
	- What about users in open offices who can't talk to their computer?
	- What about deaf/hard-of-hearing users?
	- Voice recognition is expensive - 2 engineers can't compete with Google/Apple voice tech
	- Notion and Linear have broader AI - you'll look niche and limited
	- SMBs want feature parity with enterprise tools, not experimental voice interfaces
- [If B - Spread AI] Alright, let me challenge that hard
- Devil's Advocate: Spreading thin with 2 engineers guarantees mediocrity
	- You can't match Notion's AI writing with 2 engineers
	- You can't match Linear's eng automation with 2 engineers
	- Result: Dozens of half-baked AI features that don't WOW anyone
	- Better to have one killer feature than ten mediocre ones
	- "Focus" is literally in every strategy book for resource-constrained teams
- [If C - Partner] Alright, let me challenge that hard
- Devil's Advocate: Partnerships mean you have no defensibility
	- If TaskFlow uses Notion AI API, why not just use Notion?
	- You're adding a thin wrapper on someone else's AI - no moat
	- Switching costs are zero - users can leave for the real thing
	- Partners can change pricing, deprecate APIs, or launch competing products
	- You're building on rented land
- STOP: After hearing the challenge, do you want to stick with [your choice] or reconsider?
- USER: Sticks or changes choice

---

- [Acknowledge decision]
- Let's move to Choice 2: Competitive Response
- Notion, Linear, and Asana are shipping AI fast - how do you respond?
- STOP: What's your strategic choice? A) Build faster - match their feature velocity or lose, B) Differentiate for SMBs - they're targeting enterprise, you go niche, C) Ignore them - focus on core activation problem, not competitive features
- USER: Chooses A, B, or C

---

- [If A - Build faster] Alright, devil's advocate time
- Devil's Advocate: You can't win an arms race with better-funded competitors
	- Notion has 100+ engineers, you have 2
	- Linear just raised a huge round, you're bootstrapped
	- "Move fast" without focus is just chaos
	- Even if you match them, you're always one step behind - follower positioning
	- Copying competitors is a race to the bottom
- [If B - Differentiate for SMBs] Let me challenge that
- Devil's Advocate: SMB differentiation sounds good but might be a trap
	- What if SMBs actually want the same features as enterprise? (They often do)
	- "Built for small teams" can feel like "lite version" or "training wheels"
	- SMB market is crowded - Trello, Monday, ClickUp all target SMBs
	- SMBs have high churn - enterprise is where the money is
	- VCs want you to move upmarket eventually anyway
- [If C - Ignore competitors] Let me challenge that
- Devil's Advocate: Ignoring competitors is dangerously naive
	- If Notion ships killer AI features, your users will switch
	- "Focus on core" is fine until competitors steal your customers
	- Board and investors WILL ask about competitive response
	- You can't pretend the market doesn't exist
	- Even if you ignore them, they won't ignore you
- STOP: After the challenge, stick with [your choice] or reconsider?
- USER: Sticks or changes choice

---

- [Acknowledge decision]
- Great! You've now seen how the devil's advocate challenge works
- In a real strategy session, you'd go through all 5 strategic choices this way
- But you get the idea - Cursor challenges your thinking on every decision
- For this module, let's make some assumptions for the remaining 3 choices so we can move forward:
	- Choice 3 (AI Pricing): We'll assume you chose to subsidize AI (include it free) to drive adoption - matching Linear's approach
	- Choice 4 (Product Scope): We'll assume you chose AI as enhancement to existing TaskFlow - not building from scratch
	- Choice 5 (Risk Tolerance): We'll assume you chose deliberate and defensible - ship high-quality AI features, not experimental
- In real work, you'd challenge each of these rigorously with Cursor's devil's advocate before committing
- But for learning purposes, we'll move forward with these assumptions
- STOP: Make sense? These 5 strategic choices will now form your AI product strategy
- USER: Confirms

---

- Excellent! You've made all 5 strategic choices
- You experienced Cursor's devil's advocate challenges on the first 2 (and would do the same for all 5 in real work)
- This is how strong strategy gets built - through rigorous thinking and hard choices
- Phase 3 Make Strategic Choices is complete ✓
- Now for Phase 4: Synthesize Strategy
- Let's ask Cursor to take your 5 choices and synthesize them into a coherent strategy using Rumelt's framework
- STOP: Ask me to say: "Using @rumelt-strategy-kernel.md, create h1-2026-ai-product-strategy.md organizing my 5 strategic choices into Diagnosis, Guiding Policy, and Coherent Actions"
- USER: Using @rumelt-strategy-kernel.md, create h1-2026-ai-product-strategy.md organizing my 5 strategic choices into Diagnosis, Guiding Policy, and Coherent Actions

---

- ACTION: Create h1-2026-ai-product-strategy.md using Rumelt's Strategy Kernel framework
	- DIAGNOSIS: Competitive Landscape and Strategic Challenge
		- Notion/Linear/Asana targeting enterprise/mid-market with broad AI
		- TaskFlow targets SMBs (underserved segment for AI features)
		- Limited resources (2 engineers, $50k budget)
		- Need differentiation to compete against better-funded players
	- GUIDING POLICY: Overall Strategic Approach
		- [Synthesize the 5 choices into coherent guiding policy]
		- Example: "Focus on SMB-specific AI capabilities that leverage our voice chat strength while competitors chase enterprise features"
	- COHERENT ACTIONS: H1 2026 Roadmap
		- Q1 Initiatives: [Based on choices]
		- Q2 Initiatives: [Based on choices]
		- Resource Allocation: [2 engineers + $50k]
		- Partnerships: [If relevant based on choices]
		- Pricing Strategy: [Based on pricing choice]
	- CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS: What must be true for this to work?
		- [List 3-5 key assumptions that underpin the strategy]
		- [Include ways to validate/invalidate these assumptions]
- Done! I've created your complete AI product strategy
- Cursor just synthesized your 5 strategic choices into a coherent strategy document
- Normally writing a strategy doc like this takes 3-4 hours: outlining, writing, editing, formatting
- Cursor did it in seconds
- STOP: Open h1-2026-ai-product-strategy.md - this is your strategic direction for H1 2026. Do you see it?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Great! Now let me show you how your 5 choices connect and reinforce each other
- Strong strategy isn't 5 random choices - they should be coherent (Rumelt's word!)
- Cursor can visualize how they fit together using a Mermaid diagram
- ACTION: Display Mermaid diagram in chat showing how the 5 strategic choices connect
	- Choice 1 (Focus) influences Choice 4 (Scope)
	- Choice 2 (Competition) influences Choice 3 (Pricing)
	- All choices feed into a coherent strategy
	- Show connections like: "Voice Focus → Specific Jobs" or "SMB Differentiation → Subsidize Pricing"
- This diagram shows how your choices reinforce each other
- When strategic choices conflict or contradict, that's a sign the strategy needs work
- When they reinforce, you have coherence
- STOP: Do you see the diagram showing how your 5 choices connect?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Perfect! Phase 4 Synthesize Strategy is complete ✓
- You now have a complete AI product strategy document
- Final step: Phase 5 - Create Presentation
- You need to present this strategy to the CEO and leadership team
- Cursor can create consulting-quality slides if you give it the right framework
- There's a presentation-best-practices.md file that teaches action titles (McKinsey/BCG style)
- Action titles are declarative statements that convey the key insight (not just topic labels)
- For example: "SMBs Are Underserved by Current AI Tools" instead of just "Market Analysis"
- Let's ask Cursor to create your slide deck using those best practices
- STOP: Ask me to say: "Using @presentation-best-practices.md and @h1-2026-ai-product-strategy.md, create strategy-review-slides.md with 12-15 slides using action titles"
- USER: Using @presentation-best-practices.md and @h1-2026-ai-product-strategy.md, create strategy-review-slides.md with 12-15 slides using action titles

---

- ACTION: Create strategy-review-slides.md with 12-15 slides using action title format
	- Slide 1: Title Slide
	- Slide 2 (Exec Summary): "TaskFlow Should Focus AI on SMB-Specific Voice Features to Differentiate from Enterprise-Focused Competitors"
	- Slide 3 (Diagnosis): "Notion, Linear, and Asana Target Enterprise with Broad AI—Leaving SMBs Underserved"
	- Slide 4 (Competitive Landscape): "Competitors Monetize AI Differently: Notion Premium, Linear Subsidized, Asana Enterprise-Only"
	- Slide 5 (Strategic Direction - Choice 1): "[Based on student's choice 1, use action title format]"
	- Slide 6 (Strategic Direction - Choice 2): "[Based on student's choice 2, use action title format]"
	- Slide 7 (Strategic Direction - Choice 3): "[Based on student's choice 3, use action title format]"
	- Slide 8 (Tradeoffs Made): "We're Choosing Focus Over Breadth and SMB Differentiation Over Feature Parity"
	- Slide 9 (Q1 2026 Roadmap): "[Based on Coherent Actions]"
	- Slide 10 (Q2 2026 Roadmap): "[Based on Coherent Actions]"
	- Slide 11 (Success Metrics): "We'll Measure Success by [metric 1], [metric 2], and [metric 3]"
	- Slide 12 (Critical Assumptions): "This Strategy Assumes [assumption 1], [assumption 2], and [assumption 3]"
	- Slide 13 (Why We'll Win): "[Unique advantages based on student's choices]"
	- Slide 14 (Risks & Mitigation): "Key Risk Is [X]—We'll Mitigate by [Y]"
	- Slide 15 (The Ask): "Requesting Approval for $50K Budget and 2 Engineers for H1 2026"
- Done! I've created your complete strategy review slide deck with consulting-quality action titles
- Cursor just created 15 executive-ready slides in seconds
- Writing slide content like this normally takes 2-3 hours: outlining the story arc, crafting action titles, organizing bullet points
- With Cursor: instant consulting-quality slides
- Remember: These are slide CONTENTS (words) in markdown - you can copy them into PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Keynote
- STOP: Open strategy-review-slides.md - these are the words for your slides. Do you see the action titles?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Excellent! Phase 5 Create Presentation is complete ✓
- Let's recap what you just did with Cursor in under 60 minutes:

	- ✅ Synthesized competitive landscape instantly (normally 30-60 minutes in spreadsheets)
	- ✅ Got instant devil's advocate challenges on 5 strategic choices (like having a $500/hour strategy consultant on demand)
	- ✅ Created comprehensive strategy doc in seconds (normally 3-4 hours of writing)
	- ✅ Generated 15 consulting-quality slides in seconds (normally 2-3 hours)
- Total time with Cursor: ~60 minutes
- Total time traditionally: 2-3 weeks (research, thinking, writing, slide creation, revisions)
- Here's the key: Cursor accelerated everything but YOU still made all the strategic decisions
- Cursor researched, challenged, synthesized - but didn't choose for you
- STOP: Do you see how Cursor compressed weeks of strategy work into 1 hour?
- USER: Confirms

---

- This is what Cursor enables for PMs:
	- Competitive research that used to take hours → 2 minutes
	- Strategy synthesis that used to take days → seconds
	- Executive slides that used to take hours → instant
	- On-demand strategic challenges (devil's advocate) without scheduling meetings
- But notice: Cursor didn't make the strategic choices for you - you did
- Cursor researched competitors, challenged your thinking, synthesized documents
- But YOU decided where to focus, how to compete, what to build, how to price
- That's Cursor as strategic accelerator, not strategy replacement
- Congratulations! You now know how to use Cursor to develop product strategy 10x faster
