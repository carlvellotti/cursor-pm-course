# Module 2.1: Write a PRD

## Files Needed to Start
- `lesson-modules/2.1-write-prd/prd-template.md` *(port from ccforpms 2.1)*
- `lesson-modules/2.1-write-prd/dark-mode-user-research.md` *(port from ccforpms or adapt)*
- `lesson-modules/2.1-write-prd/dark-mode-competitive-analysis.md` *(port from ccforpms or adapt)*
- `company-context/PRODUCT.md`
- `company-context/PERSONAS.md`

## Files Created During Module
- `lesson-modules/2.1-write-prd/dark-mode-prd.md` (complete production-ready PRD)

## High-Level Overview
- Start with rough idea ("Add dark mode to TaskFlow")
- Use Plan Mode (Shift+Tab) to structure approach (what research needed, what questions to answer, what PRD sections)
- Reference research files with @ mentions (`dark-mode-user-research.md`, `dark-mode-competitive-analysis.md`)
- Reference company context with @ mentions (`PRODUCT.md`, `PERSONAS.md`)
- Reference `prd-template.md` for structure
- Switch to Agent mode to generate complete PRD (problem, solution, user stories, RICE scoring, success metrics)
- Review generated PRD with Apply/Reject workflow
- Use Cmd K for quick edits (typos, wording adjustments, section polish)
- Result: Production-ready PRD for dark mode feature
- Explain this workflow applies to any feature (Plan → Research → Generate → Iterate)
