# Module 1.4: Communication Styles - The PM Superpower

## Files Needed to Start
- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/communication-styles/style-slack-update.md` *(adapt from ccforpms 1.3)*
- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/communication-styles/style-executive-email.md` *(adapt from ccforpms 1.3)*
- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/communication-styles/style-notion-doc.md` *(adapt from ccforpms 1.3)*
- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/meeting-notes-product-sync.md` (raw meeting notes)
- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/research-findings.md` (user research insights to transform)

## Files Created During Module
- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/meeting-notes-product-sync.md` (edited - summary appended using template)
- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/slack-update-output.md` (research transformed to Slack style)
- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/executive-email-output.md` (research transformed to Email style)
- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/notion-doc-output.md` (research transformed to Notion style)

## High-Level Overview
- Introduce the concept of communication style templates for consistent output formatting
- Instead of vague prompts, you can create specific templates that give you consistency and let you iterate/refine over time
- Examine three pre-made style templates in `communication-styles/` folder
- Compare differences (Slack: casual 2-3 lines, Email: strategic 3 paragraphs, Notion: comprehensive formatted)
- Use templates to get EXACTLY the format you want, every single time
- Practice appending a summary to `meeting-notes-product-sync.md` using the executive email template
- Show how using @ mentions to reference both content AND template gives consistent, professional formatting
- Use @ mentions to reference both `research-findings.md` and `communication-styles/` folder
- Transform same research into all 3 formats (Slack, Email, Notion)
- Demonstrate power of reusable styles (same info, 3 audiences, zero manual rewriting)
- PMs can iterate on templates to make them perfect, then reuse forever
- Explain this becomes a reusable PM superpower, and over time lets you create and refine powerful workflows

## Teaching Flow

- Welcome to Module 1.4: Communication Styles - The PM Superpower
- In this module you'll learn how to use templates to get consistent, professional communication formats every time
- You'll transform the same information into three different formats: Slack updates, executive emails, and Notion docs
- STOP: Ready to learn this PM superpower?
- USER: Ready

---

- Great! Let me show you three pre-made communication style templates
- These templates give you EXACTLY the format you want, every single time
- Plus, you can iterate and refine them over time to make them perfect
- You'll use these for different PM audiences throughout your work
- ACTION: List files in lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/communication-styles/ folder
- STOP: Do you see the three style template files?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Let's look at these templates to see how they differ
- ACTION: Read all three style template files and present them
	- style-slack-update.md
	- style-executive-email.md
	- style-notion-doc.md
- Notice the differences in format:
	- Slack: casual, 2-3 lines, emoji-friendly, scannable
	- Email: strategic, 3 paragraphs, executive-focused
	- Notion: comprehensive, formatted with headers, detailed
- Same information, three totally different formats for different audiences
- STOP: Make sense? Each audience gets exactly what they need
- USER: Confirms

---

- Now let's practice using templates with a real example
- You have meeting notes from a product sync that need summarizing
- Without a template, the format would be inconsistent every time you ask
- With a template, you get exactly the format you want
- Here's the key: you'll use @ mentions to reference BOTH files - the meeting notes AND the template
- STOP: Ask me to: "Append a summary to @meeting-notes-product-sync.md using the format from @style-slack-update.md"
- USER: Append a summary to @meeting-notes-product-sync.md using the format from @style-executive-email.md
- ACTION: Read meeting-notes-product-sync.md and style-slack-update.md, then edit meeting-notes-product-sync.md to append a summary formatted according to the template
- Done! I just appended a summary using the Slack template
- STOP: Do you see the summary? Notice how it follows the template's format exactly
- USER: Confirms

---

- With templates, you get that quality EVERY time
- Even better - you can refine the template once, and all future outputs improve
- That's the PM superpower: build a workflow once, reuse forever
- STOP: Does that click? Templates equal consistency plus reusability
- USER: Confirms

---

- Now let's do something really powerful
- You have research findings that need to be shared with different audiences
- Transform the same information into all THREE communication formats at once
- Slack update for your team, email for execs, Notion doc for the wiki
- Same research, three audiences, zero manual rewriting
- You'll use @ mentions to reference both the research file AND the templates folder
- STOP: Ask me to: "Transform @research-findings.md into three formats using the templates in @communication-styles/"
- USER: Transform @research-findings.md into three formats using the templates in @communication-styles/
- ACTION: Read research-findings.md and all three template files, then create three new output files
	- slack-update-output.md (research formatted in Slack style)
	- executive-email-output.md (research formatted in Email style)
	- notion-doc-output.md (research formatted in Notion style)
- Done! I just created three versions of your research, each tailored to a different audience
- STOP: Do you see all three files? Same research, totally different formats for different audiences
- USER: Confirms

---

- So when would you actually use this as a PM?
- Scenario 1: User research findings - Slack for team, email for leadership, Notion for documentation
- Scenario 2: Feature launch updates - different formats for engineering, sales, execs
- Scenario 3: Quarterly planning - transform strategy doc into stakeholder-specific formats
- The pattern: write once or gather once, then distribute in formats tailored to each audience
- STOP: Does ths make sense?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Here's why this is a superpower
- You create a template once, then refine it over time
- Every time you use it, you might tweak it slightly to make it better
- After a few iterations, you have the PERFECT template for that audience
- Then you reuse it forever - instant, consistent, professional communication
- As a PM, you'll build a library of these templates for different scenarios
- It's like having a communication toolkit that gets better over time
- STOP: Questions about templates or communication styles?
- USER: Responds

---

- Awesome! Let's recap what you learned
- You can use @ mentions to reference multiple files at once (content + template)
- Templates give you consistent, professional formatting every time
- Same information can be transformed into different formats for different audiences
- You can iterate and refine templates over time to make them perfect
- This pattern works for any PM communication: PRDs, status updates, research summaries
- In Module 1.5, you'll learn how to use agents to work on multiple tasks in parallel
- STOP: Any questions before we wrap up?
- USER: Questions or ready to continue

- Perfect! You're ready for Module 1.5
- When you're ready for the next module, open a new tab in this AI Pane and type: /start-1-5
- See you there!
