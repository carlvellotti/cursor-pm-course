# Module 1.4: Communication Styles - The PM Superpower

## Files Needed to Start
- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/communication-styles/style-slack-update.md` *(adapt from ccforpms 1.3)*
- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/communication-styles/style-executive-email.md` *(adapt from ccforpms 1.3)*
- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/communication-styles/style-notion-doc.md` *(adapt from ccforpms 1.3)*
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/meeting-notes-raw.md` (from Module 1.3, already has one summary appended)
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/user-research-insights.md` (created in Module 1.3)

## Files Created During Module
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/meeting-notes-raw.md` (edited again - second summary appended using template this time)
- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/slack-update-output.md` (research transformed to Slack style)
- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/executive-email-output.md` (research transformed to Email style)
- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/notion-doc-output.md` (research transformed to Notion style)

## High-Level Overview
- Examine three pre-made style templates in `communication-styles/` folder
- Compare differences (Slack: casual 2-3 lines, Email: strategic 3 paragraphs, Notion: comprehensive formatted)
- **Key concept:** In Module 1.3 we just said "summarize this" - now we use templates to get EXACTLY the format we want
- Revisit `meeting-notes-raw.md` from Module 1.3 - append a SECOND summary using the executive email template
- Show how using a template gives consistent, professional formatting every time
- Use @ mentions to reference both `user-research-insights.md` and `communication-styles/` folder
- Transform same research into all 3 formats (Slack, Email, Notion)
- Demonstrate power of reusable styles (same info, 3 audiences, zero manual rewriting)
- PMs can iterate on templates to make them perfect, then reuse forever
- Explain this becomes a reusable PM superpower (save 10+ hours/week)
