# Module 0.2: Opening the Course Folder

## Files Needed to Start
- None (students download course files during this module)

## Files Created During Module
- None (just downloading and opening existing files)

## High-Level Overview
- Go to course website and click "Download Course Files" button (downloads ZIP automatically - linked to GitHub release behind the scenes)
- Unzip the downloaded file to Documents folder (or desired location)
- In Cursor (already open from Module 0.1), click "Open project" button OR use File → Open Folder
- Navigate to the unzipped "cursor-for-pms" folder and click "Open"
- Verify file explorer shows course structure (company-context/, lesson-modules/, .cursor/)
- Open Composer with Cmd+I or Cmd+L
- Explain that slash commands like `/start-1-1` will now work
- Ready to begin Module 1.1
- Students never visit GitHub - download happens directly from website button
