# Module 1.5: Three Modes: Ask vs Agent vs Plan

## Files Needed to Start
- `company-context/PRODUCT.md` (for Ask mode practice)
- `lesson-modules/1.5-three-modes/practice-scenario.md` (simple feature request for Agent mode practice)

## Files Created During Module
- `lesson-modules/1.5-three-modes/prd-outline.md` (created in Agent mode practice)
- `lesson-modules/1.5-three-modes/feature-plan.md` (created in Plan mode practice)

## High-Level Overview
- Explain the three Composer modes (Ask, Agent, Plan)
- **Ask Mode:** Read-only partner - searches codebase, analyzes files, answers questions, but NEVER makes changes (safe for exploration and planning)
- Sometimes AI can be overeager to start doing STUFF and this makes sure that isn't possible.
- Practice Ask mode: "Explain what PRODUCT.md contains" and "What are the key differences between TaskFlow and competitors?"
- In reality, this mode is probably the one you will use the least
- **Agent Mode:** Autonomous executor - makes changes across multiple files, can run terminal commands, iterates on changes
- That's what we have been using so far, and is the most common mode to use
- We won't explore it too much here because we've already been using it
- **Plan Mode:** Structured planner - researches codebase, asks clarifying questions, creates Markdown plan with file paths and code references (activated with Shift+Tab), you can iterate on the plan
- It's basically a hybrid between Ask and Agent mode – it wont' make changes but it will suggest a clear path forard
- Practice Plan mode: "Plan a feature launch for [scenario]" (creates plan file, teaser for Module 1.6 deep dive)
- Explain mode switching with Cmd+. (Command + period) or mode picker
- Introduce model selection
- Explain when to use each model and how cursor pricing usage works
- If you are trying to save on credits it can make sense to plan with more powerful, expensive models and let the lower models do the rest
- But realistically you will probably always get the highest ROI just using your favorite SOTA model. PM work isn't as token-intensive as coding use cases.
- Present complete decision framework with recommended workflow: Ask (understand) → Plan (structure) → Agent (execute)
- Explain most PMs will use one of the powerful and fast models with agent mode for 90% of work
