## High-Level Overview
- Explain the three AI Pane modes (Ask, Agent, Plan)
- Explain mode switching with Cmd+. (Command + period) OR Shift + Tab OR clicking the mode picker
- **Ask Mode:** Quick introduction and light practice
	- Read-only partner - analyzes files, answers questions, but NEVER makes changes
	- Practice: "Explain what PRODUCT.md contains" (quick, then move on)
	- This mode will be used least often
- **Agent Mode:** Brief recap only (they've been using it the whole time)
	- Autonomous executor - makes changes, runs commands, iterates
	- 80% of their work will be in this mode
- **Plan Mode:** The main focus of this module - full deep dive
	- Introduce Plan Mode as the killer feature for complex PM work
	- Explain the workflow: research → clarify → plan → edit → execute
	- **Introduce web search capability** - Cursor can search the web for research (game-changer for PMs)
	- **Scenario:** Plan a multi-channel product launch campaign for a new TaskFlow feature
		- Coordinate: messaging, email sequences, in-app announcements, blog post, sales enablement, support docs, success metrics
		- Reference multiple context files: feature details, customer feedback, competitive positioning, personas
		- Use web search to research latest competitor messaging and market trends
		- Cursor researches context and asks clarifying questions ("Which customer segment first?" "Email or in-app priority?" "Timeline constraints?")
		- Student answers questions interactively
		- Cursor generates structured multi-channel launch plan with timeline
	- Practice editing the plan collaboratively (adjust messaging, reorder steps, add channels)
	- Execute plan to create launch documents
- Present complete decision framework: Ask (understand) → Plan (structure) → Agent (execute)

## Teaching Flow

- Welcome to Module 1.5: Three Modes & Plan Mode Mastery
- So far you've been using the AI Pane in one way - it reads files, makes changes, runs commands
- But the AI Pane actually has three different modes, each designed for different types of work
- Think of them like gears on a bike - same tool, different purposes
- STOP: Ready to see how they work?
- USER: Confirms

---

- The three modes are: Ask, Agent, and Plan
- You've been using Agent mode this whole time - that's the default
- Agent mode = Cursor can read AND write files, run commands, make changes
- STOP: Look at the mode picker in the lower left of the chat box - do you see where it says "Agent"?
- USER: Confirms

---

- The other two modes have specific purposes:
- Ask mode = Cursor can ONLY read and analyze, no changes allowed (safe exploration)
- Plan mode = Cursor researches and creates a structured plan, then you approve and execute it
- Each mode has a specific use case in your PM workflow
- STOP: Make sense so far?
- USER: Confirms

---

- You can switch modes three ways:
	- Click the mode picker dropdown
	- Press Cmd/Ctrl+. (Command/Control + period)
	- Press Shift+Tab
- Let's start with Ask mode since it's the safest
- STOP: Click the mode picker and switch to Ask mode
- USER: Switches to Ask mode

---

- Great! You're now in Ask mode
- In this mode, Cursor is read-only - a research partner, not an executor
- This is perfect for exploring unfamiliar codebases or new documentation without fear of messing stuff up
- Ask mode is useful for:
	- Asking questions about files and structure
	- Getting analysis without accidental changes
	- Planning before you commit to changes
- Sometimes AI can be overeager to start doing STUFF - Ask mode prevents that
- In reality, you'll probably use this mode the least, but it's useful to know it exists
- STOP: Ready to try it?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Let's try it with TaskFlow's product documentation
- STOP: Ask me: "Explain what @PRODUCT.md contains"
- USER: Explain what PRODUCT.md contains

---

- ACTION: Read company-context/PRODUCT.md and explain
- Done! Notice I only read and explained - I didn't create any files or make changes
- That's Ask mode - safe exploration without any risk
- STOP: Make sense?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Now let's talk about Agent mode - the one you've been using
- STOP: Switch back to Agent mode using any method you'd like (click picker, Cmd/Ctrl+., or Shift+Tab). Tell me when you've done it.
- USER: Confirms

---

- Agent mode is the workhorse - this is what you'll use 80% of the time
- Agent = autonomous executor
- It can:
	- Read and write files
	- Run terminal commands
	- Make changes across multiple files
	- Iterate and fix errors
- We won't practice it much here because you've already been using it in every previous module
- STOP: Make sense why this is the default mode?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Now for the main event: Plan mode
- This is Cursor's killer feature for complex PM work
- STOP: Ready to dive deep into Plan mode?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Plan mode is perfect for complex multi-step projects where you need to:
	- Coordinate across multiple channels or teams
	- Research context before committing to an approach
	- Get stakeholder buy-in on the plan before execution
	- Track progress on a structured implementation
- Here's how it works:
	- Research: Cursor reads all relevant context files
	- Clarify: Cursor asks you questions to understand constraints and priorities
	- Plan: Cursor creates a structured Markdown plan
	- Edit: You iterate on the plan together
	- Execute: You approve and Cursor builds everything
- STOP: Does this workflow make sense?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Here's what makes Plan mode powerful for PMs:
- Cursor can do web searches to supplement your local files
- This is huge for product research, competitive analysis, market trends
- You can ask Cursor to research competitors, pricing models, feature comparisons, anything
- STOP: Make sense?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Let's try a realistic PM scenario
- You're launching a new TaskFlow feature: real-time collaboration
- You need to plan a multi-channel launch campaign
- This includes: messaging strategy, email sequences, in-app announcements, blog post, sales enablement, support docs, and success metrics
- STOP: Switch to Plan mode (Shift+Tab or click the mode picker). Tell me when you're ready.
- USER: Confirms

---

- Perfect! You're now in Plan mode
- I'm going to show you the feature details we're launching
- ACTION: Read lesson-modules/1.5-three-modes/feature-announcement.md. Read and present the feature announcement details
- STOP: Sound like a realistic PM task?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Here's where Plan mode shows its power
- When you give Plan mode a complex request, it automatically researches your documents and asks clarifying questions
- This helps ensure the plan matches your specific needs
- STOP: Ask me: "Plan a multi-channel launch campaign for this feature. Research our positioning, competitors, and target customers, then create a comprehensive go-to-market plan."
- USER: Plan a multi-channel launch campaign for this feature. Research our positioning, competitors, and target customers, then create a comprehensive go-to-market plan.

---

- ACTION: Plan mode researches context files and performs web searches automatically
- Now Plan mode is asking clarifying questions
- Question 1: Which customer segment should we prioritize - Enterprise teams or SMB teams?
- STOP: What's your answer?
- USER: [Answers - e.g., "Enterprise first"]

---

- Question 2: What's your timeline - soft launch in 2 weeks with full launch in 4 weeks, or different timing?
- STOP: What timeline works?
- USER: [Answers - e.g., "2 week beta, 4 week full launch"]

---

- Question 3: Should we lead with email campaign, in-app announcement, or coordinated simultaneous launch?
- STOP: What's your preference?
- USER: [Answers - e.g., "Coordinated simultaneous launch"]

---

- Perfect! Plan mode has everything it needs
- Now it's generating the plan document.
- If things look good, Click Build and it will begin!
- If you want to make any modifications, just ask for them in this chat and Cursor will make updates until you are satisfied.
- ACTION: Plan mode creates a PLAN showing:
	- **Files to create:** launch-campaign-plan.md, launch-timeline.md
	- **Structure for launch-campaign-plan.md:**
		- Executive summary
		- Target audience (Enterprise focus)
		- Key messaging pillars
		- Multi-channel campaign (email, in-app, blog, sales, support)
		- Success metrics
	- **Structure for launch-timeline.md:**
		- Week-by-week execution phases
		- Deliverable owners
		- Dependencies and milestones
	- **Execution order:** Research → Draft messaging → Create campaign materials → Launch sequence

---

- Watch Plan mode execute the plan!
- ACTION: Plan mode switches to execution mode and creates:
	- lesson-modules/1.5-three-modes/launch-campaign-plan.md (following the planned structure)
	- lesson-modules/1.5-three-modes/launch-timeline.md (following the planned structure)
- Plan mode tracks progress as it builds each file
- Done! All deliverables created exactly as outlined in the plan
- STOP: Do you see the two new files that were just created?
- USER: Confirms

---

- This is the power of Plan mode
- The complete workflow was:
	1. You gave one complex prompt
	2. Plan mode researched files and did web searches (automatic)
	3. Plan mode asked clarifying questions
	4. Plan mode generated a detailed PLAN document (the blueprint)
	5. You reviewed and iterated on the plan
	6. You clicked "Build"
	7. Plan mode executed and created everything
- This "plan first, build later" approach is perfect for complex PM work
- You get to review the strategy before any work is done
- STOP: Can you see how powerful this is for complex PM projects?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Finally let's summarize when to use use each mode
- Here's the decision framework:
- **Ask mode:**
	- Exploring new files or codebases
	- Need information without risk of changes
	- Quick analysis or research
- **Agent mode:**
	- 80% of your daily work
	- Making changes, creating files, implementing features
	- Anything hands-on and tactical
- **Plan mode:**
	- Complex multi-step projects
	- Need to coordinate across teams or channels
	- Want to iterate on approach before executing
	- Large projects where "measure twice, cut once" applies
- STOP: Which mode do you think you'd use for writing a PRD?
- USER: [May answer - probably Agent or Plan depending on complexity]

---

- Good thinking! It depends on the complexity
- Simple PRD for a small feature? Agent mode - just do it
- Complex PRD for a multi-phase feature with cross-team dependencies? Plan mode - research, plan, iterate, execute
- The key is: Plan mode is for when you need structure before action
- STOP: Make sense?
- USER: Confirms

---

- Excellent! You've now mastered all three modes
- Quick recap:
	- **Ask mode:** Read-only exploration (safest)
	- **Agent mode:** Autonomous execution (most common)
	- **Plan mode:** Structured planning for complex work (most powerful)
- Mode switching: Click the picker, Cmd/Ctrl+., or Shift+Tab
- Plus you learned about web search - a game-changer for PM research
- And you just planned a complete multi-channel product launch in minutes
- That's something that would normally take hours of meetings and back-and-forth
- STOP: Any questions about the three modes or Plan mode workflow?
- USER: [May ask questions or confirm done]

---

- (If questions):
- [Answer their questions]
- STOP: Anything else?
- USER: No / another question
- (Repeat if needed, then continue)

---

- Fantastic work! You now have the complete Cursor AI Pane toolkit
- You can switch between modes based on what you need
- You can use web search to supplement your knowledge
- And you can tackle complex multi-step projects with Plan mode
