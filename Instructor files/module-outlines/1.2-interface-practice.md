## Teaching Flow

- Welcome to Module 1.2: Cursor Interface - Hands-On Practice
- In Module 1.1 you learned what Cursor is for PMs and how this course works
- Now we're going to get hands-on with Cursor's interface
- No more just talking - you're going to DO things and tell me what you see
- Ready to explore?
- STOP: Wait for user confirmation
- USER: Yes / Ready

---

- Great! Let's start by finding a file
- Look at the left side of your screen - see the file explorer?
- If not, press Cmd/Ctrl+B to toggle it
- ACTION: Explain that the file explorer shows the course folder structure
- You should see folders like company-context/, lesson-modules/, and .cursor/
- STOP: Ask user to describe what folders they see
- USER: Describes seeing folders
- Perfect! That's your file explorer - you'll use this constantly

---

- Now let's open a specific file
- In the file explorer, navigate to lesson-modules → 1.2-interface
- You should see a file called interface-practice.md
- Click it to open it
- Now you should see the file contents in the middle of your screen
- At the very top of the file, there should be a secret code
- STOP: Ask: "What's the secret code at the top of the file?"
- USER: PANCAKE

---

- Excellent! You found it.
- Before we go further, let's understand your workspace layout
- You're currently looking at THREE main areas
- Here's what they are:
  - Left: File explorer (navigate files and folders - you just used this!)
  - Middle: Editor pane (shows interface-practice.md - you're looking at it now)
  - Right: AI Pane (where you're talking to me right now!)
- This three-pane layout is your workspace for ALL PM work in Cursor
- File explorer → Editor → AI Pane
- You can also open a terminal as a bottom tab with ctrl + ` (backtick). You won't need that much for this course, but that's where you can run commads or open Claude Code IN Cursor.
- STOP: Does this layout make sense?
- USER: Yes / needs clarification

---

- Now let's do something cool with that file you just opened
- In the editor (middle pane), you're seeing raw Markdown - all the # symbols and formatting codes
- Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+V
- STOP: Ask: "What happened? Do you see a more nicely formatted doc?"
- USER: Confirms
- Exactly! You're now seeing the formatted version
- Headers look like headers, bullets look like bullets
- Press Cmd+Shift+V again to toggle back to raw Markdown
- STOP: Ask user to toggle it a few times to see the difference
- USER: User confirms

---

- This preview feature is super helpful for PMs
- You'll be creating lots of Markdown documents - PRDs, updates, roadmaps
- Being able to preview how they'll look keeps your docs professional
- But there's something even better - a true "What you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) editor, meaning you can edit a formatted doc directly, like Google Docs or Notion
- We're going to install an extension called "Markdown Editor" for this
- If you need any help with this stuff, you can also view the reference doc for screenshots.
- Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette, a quick way to run any Cursor command
- Type: "Extensions: Install Extensions"
- You should now see the Extensions panel on the left
- In the search box, type: "Markdown Editor"
- Look for the one by "zaaack" - it has a blue icon with "M" and down arrows
- STOP: Ask: "Do you see 'Markdown Editor' by zaaack?"
- USER: Confirms
- Perfect! Click the Install button
- STOP: Ask user to say "Installed it"
- USER: Confirms
- Great! Open a .md file and use the command 'cmd/ctrl + shift + alt/opt + m' and you should see the direct editor.
- STOP: Ask use "Got it?"
- USER: Confirms (if they are struggling, tell them they can view the reference file for the module. And this is not critical for the course.)

---

- Now let's learn how to reference information in the AI Pane
- There are THREE ways to do this, and each has its own use case
- We'll practice all three\*
- **Method 1: @ mentions (MOST COMMON)**
- Look at the input box down here where you've been typing to me
- Type: Tell me about @company
- You should see COMPANY.md in the list - select it
- STOP: Ask: "Type 'tell me about @COMPANY.md"
- USER: Use enters command
- Do it
- Perfect! This is how you'll reference files 90% of the time
- You can do @Files, @Folders, @Web, @Code, @Git, and more
- STOP: Ready for the next way?
- USER: Confirms

---

- **Method 2: Drag files directly**
- Some people prefer a more visual approach
- In the file explorer on the left, find company-context/COMPANY.md
- Click and drag it into the input box down here
- STOP: Ask: "What happened?"
- USER: Describes file pill appearing (same as @ mention)
- Exactly! Same result, different method
- This is great when you're already browsing files
- Remove the pill again
- STOP: Done?
- USER: Yes

---

- **Method 3: "Add to Chat" for SPECIFIC TEXT**
- This one is different - it's not for whole files
- It's for when you want to reference a specific quote or section
- Open COMPANY.md in the editor by clicking it in the file explorer. This method ONLY works when viewing the raw .md file unfortunately.
- STOP: Ask: "Is the file open in the middle pane?"
- USER: Yes
- Great! Now highlight any paragraph of text - just click and drag to select it
- See "Add to Chat" floating nearby? Click it, and you will see it appear in the chat below.
- STOP: Ask me to make some kind of edit, like translating your selection to another language
- USER: Confirms
- Do it
- This is super useful for quoting user feedback, excerpts from docs, or specific sections
- STOP: Got it?
- USER: Confirms

---

- So to recap the three ways:
  1. @ mentions - Quick, keyboard-driven, most common (whole files)
  2. Drag files - Visual, mouse-driven (whole files)
  3. "Add to Chat" - For specific quotes/excerpts (selected text only)
- You'll use @ mentions most, but all three are valuable
- STOP: Make sense?
- USER: Yes / questions

---

- Finally, let's talk about the AI model selector
- Look at the very bottom of this AI Pane - where you're talking to me right now
- STOP: Ask: "Do you see a dropdown that says 'Claude 4.5 Sonnet' or similar?"
- USER: Yes / describes what they see
- That's the model selector
- Cursor allows you to choose basically any model, including new models as soon as they are released.
- Carl generally recommends using the latest Claude Sonnet model, but different people have different preferences, so you'll need to experiment. And sometimes it's helpful to switch between them to see different approaches.
- Cursor has usage limits and pricing, but PM work uses way fewer tokens than coding, so Carl's strong recommendation is just to use whatever top-tier model of your favorite provider is available. It's the best ROI.
- You'll likely never hit limits doing PRDs and docs.
- STOP: Does that make sense?
- USER: Yes / questions about models

---

- Here's something important: You're already IN the AI Pane right now, talking to me!
- But there's ANOTHER way to use Cursor's AI - for quick inline edits
- Make sure interface-practice.md is still open in the editor (middle pane)
- Again this only works in the raw mode.
- Click anywhere in that file to put your cursor on a line of text
- Now click "Quick Edit" or press Cmd/Ctrl+K
- It's scoped to just the file you're editing, and appears right where your cursor is
- Use it for quick fixes: "Fix this typo", "Rephrase this sentence", "Make this shorter"
- Try it
- STOP: Did you test it?
- USER: Confirms
- This is an amazing way to integrate LLMs more tactically into your work.
- The AI Pane (where you are now) is for bigger work: creating files, analyzing multiple docs, planning
- You can open the AI Pane with Cmd+I anytime (or Cmd+L - they do the same thing)
- STOP: Clear on the difference between Cmd+K and the AI Pane?
- USER: Yes / needs clarification

---

- Fantastic! You've learned the key parts of Cursor's interface
- Let's recap what you can do now:
  - Navigate files with the file explorer (left pane)
  - Edit and preview Markdown files (middle pane)
  - Talk to AI through the AI Pane (right pane - where you are now!)
  - Reference files with @ mentions (most common)
  - Drag files into the AI Pane (alternative method)
  - Add specific text with "Add to Chat" (for excerpts)
  - Switch between AI models (though you'll mostly use Sonnet)
  - Use Cmd+K for quick inline edits
- These are the building blocks for everything else
- In Module 1.3, you'll use these skills to do actual PM work
- STOP: Any final questions before we wrap up?
- USER: Questions or ready to continue

---

- Perfect! You're ready for Module 1.3
- Close this AI Pane
- When you're ready for the next module, open a new AI Pane (Cmd+I) and type: /start-1-3
- See you there!
