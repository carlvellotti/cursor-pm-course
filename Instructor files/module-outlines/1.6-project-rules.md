# Module 1.7: Project Rules: .cursor/rules

## Files Needed to Start
- `.cursor/rules/course-instructor.mdc` (already exists from course setup)
- `.cursor/rules/taskflow-context.mdc` (already exists from course setup)

## Files Created During Module
- `product-update-baseline.md` (generated WITHOUT rules - baseline version)
- `.cursor/rules/taskflow-terminology.mdc` (student creates this WITH Cursor's help)
- `product-update-with-rules.md` (same document generated WITH rules - shows the difference)

## High-Level Overview
- **Step 1: Create baseline document** - Ask Cursor to "Write a product update announcing the new Workspace Sharing feature" → save as `product-update-baseline.md`
- **Step 2: Show the problem** - Review baseline - likely uses inconsistent terminology, generic writing, no persona references
- **Step 3: Explain what rules do** - Show existing rules files (course-instructor.mdc, taskflow-context.mdc) - "This is WHY Cursor has known about TaskFlow all course!"
- Explain: Rules auto-apply to all sessions, no @mention needed, like giving Cursor persistent memory
- **Step 4: Create rules file WITH Cursor's help** - Ask Cursor in Agent mode: "Help me create `.cursor/rules/taskflow-terminology.mdc` with our terminology and style preferences"
- Include: Terminology ("Workspace" not "Project"), personas (Sarah, Mike, Alex), writing style (active voice, Oxford commas, no emojis)
- Cursor generates the rule file itself (meta!)
- **Step 5: Test the rules** - Ask Cursor the EXACT same prompt: "Write a product update announcing the new Workspace Sharing feature" → save as `product-update-with-rules.md`
- **Step 6: Compare before/after** - Open both files side-by-side, see the dramatic difference
- Validation: "What's different? Does it use 'Workspace'? Does it mention personas? Is the style better?"
- **Magic moment:** Same prompt, completely different (better) output
- Explain project rules (this folder only) vs global rules (all projects)
- Explain when to use rules in real PM work (company terminology, product context, team style guides)
