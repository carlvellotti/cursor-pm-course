## Module 1.3: Your First PM Tasks: @ Mentions & File Operations

### Files Needed to Start
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/meeting-notes-raw.md` *(port from ccforpms 1.3)*
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/product-sync-notes.md` *(port from ccforpms 1.3)*
- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/user-interviews/user-interview-01.md` through `08.md` *(port from ccforpms 1.3)*

- `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/user-research-insights.md` (synthesis of 8 interviews)

### High-Level Overview
- **Scenario 1: Append to Existing File** - Use @ mention or "Add to Chat" on `meeting-notes-raw.md`, ask Cursor to append a summary section to the bottom of the same file
- Teaches: editing existing files in-place
- Introduce Apply/Reject workflow (review changes before accepting – you usually just want to Accept All)
- **Scenario 2: Transform to New File** - Use @ mention on `product-sync-notes.md`, ask Cursor to create a separate executive email summary in new file `product-sync-email.md`
- Practice Apply/Reject again (review before accepting)
- Teaches: reading one file, creating new formatted output
- **Scenario 3: Folder Analysis to New File** - Use @ mention on `user-interviews/` folder (8 files), create insights document synthesizing all interviews
- Teaches: multi-file analysis, folder-level operations
- Validate learning (what summary was appended? what's in the email? what's the #1 pain point from interviews?)

- `lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/notion-doc-output.md` (research transformed to Notion style)

### High-Level Overview
- Examine three pre-made style templates in `communication-styles/` folder
- Compare differences (Slack: casual 2-3 lines, Email: strategic 3 paragraphs, Notion: comprehensive formatted)
- **Key concept:** In Module 1.3 we just said "summarize this" - now we use templates to get EXACTLY the format we want
- Revisit `meeting-notes-raw.md` from Module 1.3 - append a SECOND summary using the executive email template
- Show how using a template gives consistent, professional formatting every time
- Use @ mentions to reference both `user-research-insights.md` and `communication-styles/` folder
- Transform same research into all 3 formats (Slack, Email, Notion)
- Demonstrate power of reusable styles (same info, 3 audiences, zero manual rewriting)
- PMs can iterate on templates to make them perfect, then reuse forever
- Explain this becomes a reusable PM superpower (save 10+ hours/week)

## Module 1.5: Three Modes: Ask vs Agent vs Plan

### Files Needed to Start
- `company-context/PRODUCT.md` (for Ask mode practice)
- `lesson-modules/1.5-three-modes/practice-scenario.md` (simple feature request for Agent mode practice)

### Files Created During Module
- `lesson-modules/1.5-three-modes/prd-outline.md` (created in Agent mode practice)
- `lesson-modules/1.5-three-modes/feature-plan.md` (created in Plan mode practice)

### High-Level Overview
- Explain the three Composer modes (Ask, Agent, Plan)
- **Ask Mode:** Read-only partner - searches codebase, analyzes files, answers questions, but NEVER makes changes (safe for exploration and planning)
- Practice Ask mode: "Explain what PRODUCT.md contains" and "What are the key differences between TaskFlow and competitors?"
- **Agent Mode:** Autonomous executor - makes changes across multiple files, can run terminal commands, iterates on changes
- Practice Agent mode: "Create PRD outline from `practice-scenario.md`" (creates actual file)
- **Plan Mode:** Structured planner - researches codebase, asks clarifying questions, creates Markdown plan with file paths and code references (activated with Shift+Tab)
- Practice Plan mode: "Plan a feature launch for [scenario]" (creates plan file, teaser for Module 1.6 deep dive)
- Explain mode switching with Cmd+. (Command + period) or mode picker
- Introduce model selection
- Explain when to use each model and how cursor pricing usage works
- If you are trying to save on credits it can make sense to plan with more powerful, expensive models and let the lower models do the rest
- But realistically you will probably always get the highest ROI just using your favortite SOTA model. PM work isn't as token-intensive as coding use cases.
- Present complete decision framework with recommended workflow: Ask (understand) → Plan (structure) → Agent (execute)
- Explain most PMs will use one of the powerful and fast models with agent mode for 90% of work

## Module 1.6: Plan Mode Mastery

### Files Needed to Start
- `lesson-modules/1.6-plan-mode/feature-announcement.md` (new feature to launch - e.g., real-time collaboration)
- `lesson-modules/1.6-plan-mode/target-customers.md` (customer segments and feedback)
- `lesson-modules/1.6-plan-mode/competitive-positioning.md` (how competitors message similar features)
- `company-context/PRODUCT.md` (for product context)
- `company-context/PERSONAS.md` (for audience targeting)

### Files Created During Module
- `lesson-modules/1.6-plan-mode/launch-campaign-plan.md` (comprehensive go-to-market plan created in Plan Mode)
- `lesson-modules/1.6-plan-mode/launch-timeline.md` (execution timeline with owners)

### High-Level Overview
- Introduce Plan Mode as Cursor's killer feature (superior to Claude Code's planning)
- Explain Shift+Tab workflow to activate Plan Mode
- Demonstrate Plan Mode phases (research → clarify → plan → edit → execute)
- **Scenario: Plan a product launch campaign** (not coding - pure PM work)
- Need to coordinate: messaging, email sequences, in-app announcements, blog post, sales enablement, support docs, success metrics
- Reference multiple context files: feature details, customer feedback, competitive positioning, personas
- Cursor researches context and asks clarifying questions ("Which customer segment first?" "Email or in-app priority?" "Timeline constraints?")
- Student answers questions interactively
- Cursor generates structured multi-channel launch plan with timeline
- Practice editing the plan collaboratively (adjust messaging, reorder steps, add channels)
- Execute plan to create launch documents (or save plan for later)
- Explain when to use Plan Mode (complex multi-step work requiring coordination across teams/channels)

## Module 1.7: Project Rules: .cursor/rules

### Files Needed to Start
- `.cursor/rules/course-instructor.mdc` (already exists from course setup)
- `.cursor/rules/taskflow-context.mdc` (already exists from course setup)

### Files Created During Module
- `product-update-baseline.md` (generated WITHOUT rules - baseline version)
- `.cursor/rules/taskflow-terminology.mdc` (student creates this WITH Cursor's help)
- `product-update-with-rules.md` (same document generated WITH rules - shows the difference)

### High-Level Overview
- **Step 1: Create baseline document** - Ask Cursor to "Write a product update announcing the new Workspace Sharing feature" → save as `product-update-baseline.md`
- **Step 2: Show the problem** - Review baseline - likely uses inconsistent terminology, generic writing, no persona references
- **Step 3: Explain what rules do** - Show existing rules files (course-instructor.mdc, taskflow-context.mdc) - "This is WHY Cursor has known about TaskFlow all course!"
- Explain: Rules auto-apply to all sessions, no @mention needed, like giving Cursor persistent memory
- **Step 4: Create rules file WITH Cursor's help** - Ask Cursor in Agent mode: "Help me create `.cursor/rules/taskflow-terminology.mdc` with our terminology and style preferences"
- Include: Terminology ("Workspace" not "Project"), personas (Sarah, Mike, Alex), writing style (active voice, Oxford commas, no emojis)
- Cursor generates the rule file itself (meta!)
- **Step 5: Test the rules** - Ask Cursor the EXACT same prompt: "Write a product update announcing the new Workspace Sharing feature" → save as `product-update-with-rules.md`
- **Step 6: Compare before/after** - Open both files side-by-side, see the dramatic difference
- Validation: "What's different? Does it use 'Workspace'? Does it mention personas? Is the style better?"
- **Magic moment:** Same prompt, completely different (**better**) output
- Explain project rules (this folder only) vs global rules (all projects)
- Explain when to use rules in real PM work (company terminology, product context, team style guides)

## Summary: Files to Port from Claude Code Course

**Definitely reuse (minimal adaptation):**
- User interview files (Module 1.3, 2.2)
- Meeting notes files (Module 1.3)
- CSV survey data (Module 2.3)
- Competitive analysis files (Module 2.1)

**Adapt for Cursor:**
- Communication style templates (Module 1.4) - same concept, Cursor syntax
- PRD template (Module 2.1) - same structure, mention Cursor features
- Dark mode research files (Modules 1.6, 2.1) - same content

**Create new for Cursor:**
- `interface-practice.md` with secret codes (Module 1.2)
- `.cursor/rules/taskflow-terminology.mdc` (Module 1.7 - students create this)
- Practice scenario files for Module 1.5

---

**Total files to port from ccforpms:** ~20-25 files
**Total new files to create:** ~5-8 files
**Efficiency:** ~75% reuse from existing Claude Code course
